reading: excerpts from "power concedes nothing" by Connie Rice

Reading Questions: 
In the excerpts from the book, Rice navigates a very complicated landscape and its clear that her passion for police reform and dedication to underserved and overpoliced neighborhoods allows her to remain focused on her mission. Throughout multiple lawsuits and reports, fact-finding councils and meetings, Rice is able to interact, extract information from, and work with strange bedfellows towards her overarching aim. I found the voice in the book to be tiresome, but the situations in which she found herself were instructive. What I was most interested in was the negotiations with Bratton about how to approach the final CRASH investigation. 
I think Rice was in a unique position, but I have faced similar issues when dealing with community partners on negotiating how best to allow researchers access to their data. The teams I have been on are tasked with persuading community organizations that researchers will use their data responsibly, and that by allowing them access, we could collaborate on a research agenda. I suspect that Rice had similar notions of demanding access to police records and subpoena power, in order to help the LAPD understand the full scope of the misconduct and issues they faced with the Ramparts scandal.

Kindy: Insurers force change on police departments long resistant to it

- police chief aaron jimenez had to make the calculation to impose new rules on when officers engaged in high speed chases after the insurance trust risk pool threatened to cancel their liability coverage. 

"Larger law enforcement agencies — like the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department or
the New York Police Department — handle it in different ways, often by creating
a special fund to finance settlements or by paying those costs from the county’s
or city’s general fund. This insulates them from external demands by insurers." 

I won't pretend that I didn't thoroughly enjoy reading the Kindy article. The idea that insurance companies could be instrumental in forcing police departments to internalize the costs of overly aggressive policing is delightful to me. I trust actuaries much more than I trust police to accurately judge the risks of policing, and because they have the data on settlements and lawsuits, they are in a unique position to price that risk. This is not an ideal model, because as noted in the article, private insurance pools are not subject to the same transparency and public accountability that some type of public insurance corporation would be, however, I think states could take inspiration from the example of private insurerers, creating a public insurance pool in the same way as the healthcare markets worked. Participation could be tied to state funding for policing, and coverage could be contingent on police departments adhering to some standard of training and commitment to reducing the risk of police misconduct. 

The Rapaport paper continues this thought by noting that the insurance companies themselves could be regulated by states. Rapaport's description of moral hazard relating to police misconduct is appropriate, in that it allows police department's and their jurisdictions to externalize the costs of their actions: "Liability insurance dilutes, or even neutralizes, deterrence by transferring the risk of liability from the municipality to the insurer" (1543). The description of intragovernmental risk pools, and their behavior was interesting to me, because it signals the capability of these groups to self-police: "high-performing members can encourage troubled municipalities to take loss prevention more seriously and advise them about its implementation." In this instance, loss prevention refers to police departments engaging six broad types of actions that reduce the risk of liability: 1) pocliy development, 2) education and training, 3) audits, 4) accreditation, 5) personnel, 6) omnibus and structural reforms. Rapaport's investigation reveals differing levels of success in each of these types of "regulation" by insurers, but the access and sometimes level of oversight allowed in some cases by insurers is farther reaching than a lot of municipalities have over their police departments, and could be incorporated into a public version of insurance and oversight.

Pattern of Practice Investigation: Chicago Police Department

Findings Report: 
2015 pattern or practice of unlawful conduct within CPD (and) IPRA (Independent Police Review Authority)  
Assessed: 
- use of force, trainings, reporting, accountability in CPD and IPRA 
- also investigated racial disparities in CPD's use of force
- after laquan mcdonald shooting

Process:
- reviewed documents from CPD, IPRA, the city 
- accessed city's entire misconduct database
- spent over 300 person-days in chicago 
- met with over 90 community groups 
- during the investigation, city created COPA (civilian office of police accountability) to replace IPRA

Findings: 
- "But even within this context, we, in consultation with several active law enforcement experts, found that CPD officers engage in a pattern or practice of using force, including deadly force, that is unreasonable. We found further that CPD officers’ force practices unnecessarily endanger themselves and others and result in unnecessary and avoidable shootings and other uses of force."
- "CPD also has failed to hold officers accountable when they use force contrary to CPD policy or otherwise commit misconduct." 
- "We found further that CPD’s failure to meaningfully and routinely review or investigate officer use of force is a significant factor in perpetuating the practices that result in the pattern of unlawful conduct we found."  

Accountability:
- "The City received over 30,000 complaints of police misconduct during the five years preceding our investigation, but fewer than 2% were sustained, resulting in no discipline in 98% of these complaints"  

Results: 
- City entered into an "Agreement in Principle" with the DOJ in 2017
- Chicago entered into a consent decree in 2019
