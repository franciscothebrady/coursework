## Auditor/Inspector General Model 

What do auditors actually do?  
- lots! and it varies from one place to another 
- special focus on use-of-force reviews and complaints review 
- not the same as CCRB model 
    - auditor doesn't conduct the investigation themselves

Example: Portland Independent Police Review 
- 2023 annual report focused on reviewing policies relating to the police accountability system and how the Buerau responds to domestic violence calls

1. Responsibilities for reviewing use-of-force incidents and investigating civilian complaints is divided between CCRB and Internal Affairs Department 
2. Second order review of how the police department conducted the review -- **this is what the auditor does** 

Auditor is quality control over departments processes. 
- In the process of doing that, may see policies that need to be changed or amended, after identifying patterns of misconduct or issues.  

Example:
- portland did a deeper review of domestic violence response.  

In places like Portland and NYC, the auditor has a broad latitude to review more than just use-of-force incidents and complaints. 
> they serve as policy review auditors as well  

### results 
- quality varies from one place to another 
- at best you get thoughtful review of policies that may not have been scrutinized as extensively 
- at worst maybe some not so thorough review of police department work  


### strengths and weaknesses  
- Strengths: 
    - unlike consent decrees, is not federal oversight
    - can provide long-term monitoring
    - credibility of long term knowledge and local context
    - increased transparency, bringing media or govt attention to specific police practices 
- Weaknesses: 
    - recommendations are not binding (this could be a strength)
    - mostly non-police 

### staffing of auditors 
- sometimes lots of lawyers
