#### State of the Nation's Housing 2023  

Housing wasn't a top priority of hte federal government. There was a perception that housing was affordable in the United States.  

In the past, the consensus was that housing affordability was a local problem.  

Ths is evidenced by the fact that HUD was the weakest cabinet department.  

It used to be tough to be get research grants for housing while it was easier for transportation.  

Low supply of construction workers tying that back to housing crisis (2008).  

Housing market had a boom in early 2000s.  

Lots of changes in american cities. Urban areas have become more popular and land prices have risen significantly.  

Standards for housing have changed:  
-  environmental regulations  
-  construction standards  
-  inclusionary housing requirements (affordable housing requirements)  

How can we also ensure adequate supply of housing for middle class?  

Solution: we have to expand the overall supply of housing.  
Lots of studies saying that zoning and regulations can increase development costs.  

Housing crisis today is the overall undersupply of housing -- not just lower income and localized.  

Process of mfiltering: How long does it taqke? 
-  what are the factors that affect the effectiveness of the flitering process.  
-  supply issue might prevent housing from being filtered at all.  
- there is a filter mechanism, the question is whether or not the filtering is effective.  

Affordability in terms of mortgage costs: need to earn around $110,000 to afford a median price home, as a functino of current interest rates.

### Today's Topics 
-  why is housing different
-  housing demand 
-  housing supply  

### Why is housing different?  

-  Housing is durable -- it will be used for many years.  
-  Buying and selling behaviors change throughout ones life-cycle  
-  Housing is a basic need  
-  Housing is a heavily regulated sector -- the reason why gov'ts are allowed to do this is because there is a recognition that housing is not just a private good.  
-  Housing is so important that there is a need for the pubic sector to regulate it.  

##### Housing is a public good / social good.  

-  Housing has asset value -- changes in value can be large and can treated as an investment/speculatively  
-  Demand for housing can change over time  
    -  Comparing rust belt cities with areas with newer housing stock.  

For older housing stock you have to think about maintenance.  

-  Housing is fixed in location -- you can't move houses easily.  

### why is housing different (from the slides) 
-  Housing is heterogeneous (houses can differ from each other in many ways)  
-  housing is fixed in location  
-  housing is durable  
-  housing is expensive  

### housing is heterogeneous  
each dwelling offers a different set of features of a differnt bundle of housing services  
-  dwelling characteristics:  
    -  structures and size  
    -  design  
-  site characteristics  
    -  accessibility 
    -  neigh quality  
    -  pub services and taxes  
    -  environ quality  

housing market is a product differentiated market  

#### housing is fixeds in location  
-  neigh quality is very important (externalities)  
-  housing market is segmented  
    -  housing market is a set of overlapping sub-markets differentiated by sixze, location, and quality  
    -  this means supply/demand relationship can be different in each submarket  
    -  housing submarkets are also related: buildings from different sumarkets are impefect subsitutes and households can move between.  

#### housing is durable  
-  most supply comes from existing stock, but the ecisting stock can be upgraded  
-  newly built housing is a small portion of total supply  
-  Naturally occuring afforable housing -- not subsidized.  
-  most of the affordable supply in the us is this type -- housing that has been filtered down.  
-  housing supply is determined not only bt the production decisions of builders of new units, but also by the decisions of excisting propperty owners concerning the conversionj of their units.  
-  new housing is only a small part of the total housing supply, a fundamental reason for the volatility of the development industry. (this is true in the united states)  

#### Housing is expensive  
-  large fraction of households rent instead of owning.  
-  borrowing (mortgage) is needed to purchage a home  
-  most middle-0income household use homeownershpi to avccimulate wealth  
-  need to worry about euity issues, particularly affordability  
-  need to worry about policy failures that may further raise ohusing costs such as overly restrictive regulations.  

#### high transaction costs in housing markets  
-  search costs  
-  legal and admin costs  
-  adjustmetn costs (moving costs)  
-  expectations and uncertainty  
-  financing costs  

has the effect of reducing mobility, wchih has implications on household welfare  

#### housing is both a private and social good  
-  Housing is a private good:  
    -  housing is a consumption good 'consumed' by indiv households. 
    -  housing is an investment good.  
-  housing is a social good:  
    -  housing is joinly 'consumed' by household and their community. the quality of your housing, and your contribution to the neigh caffects your neighbors consummption & utility.  
    -  housing is a basic human need. the right to housing!  
    -  good housing makes good citizens(?)

2-3% of us households live in publkic housing, <10% live in gov't subsidized housing. 

1 out of 4 eligible hosuehold has been able to live in some sort of gov't subsidized housing.  

### fundamentals of housing demand  

#### what being demanded on the housing market?  
-  the stock measure of housing -- the actual structures or housing units  
    -  in the owner-occupied sector, is it the housing units being traded.  
-  the flow measure of hosuing -- housing services.  
    -  in the rental sector, it is housing services being traded.  
    

**hosuing services are heterogenous**  

#### factors affecting housing demand  

-  individual housing demadn is shaped by:  
    -  financial resources of consumers (income and wealth)  
    -  price (user-cost) of ohusing relative to the prices of other goods  
    -  consumers taste for housing  
    -  factors affecting the investment-drive demand  

(first 3 points -- market fundamentals, investment is very different, can come from outside the market and have no relationship to the use of housing at all)  

-  The aggregate market ohusing demand is affected by:  
    -  the total number and types of households  
    -  other factors: political factors, immigration, climate change(!)  

### the housing demand curve  

[put a pic here of demand curves]  

**how sensitive is the change in housign demand in response to privce changes?**

$$
Elasticity = \frac{\Delta{Q/Q}}{\Delta{P/P}}
$$

price elastiticty of housing demand = percentage change in quantity being demanded / percentage change in housing price  

> when housing supply is negative, demand is elastic.  

> **higher income households tend to be more elastic than lower income households**  

### Housing demand and income changes  
-  two types of income:  
    -  permanent income (aka wealth) v.s. current income  
    -  how sensitive is the change in housing deamdn in response to cincome changes?  

> the income elasticity of demand = percentage change in quantity being demanded / percentage change in household income  

##### ( income elasticity of demand tends to be close to 1 )

tldr housing is a normal good.  

### housings demographic demand  

-  what factors affect housings demographic demand ?  
-  is housing's demographic demand independent of housing market conditions?  

## 2023-09-14  

[Southeast Michigan Coalition of Governments](https://www.semcog.org/community-profiles)  
-  they have demogrpahic profiles on their website and other statistics  

Last time:  
-  talked about demand  
-  some issues in housing supply  

### what is being supplied on the housing market?  

Need to distinguish between demand for housing services (rent) and demand for housing ownership.  

-  flow supply of housing services  
    -  how can the supplyo fo hosuing services be changed? 
    -  there are things landlords can do to change the level of housing services (renovations, etc)  
    -  same is true for mismanagement/lack of maintenance (reduce the level of housing qwuality)  
-  the stock supply of housing:  
    -  net additions = new construction - depreciation and demolition  
    -  depreciation: economic depreciation (value declines) _and_ physical depreciation (quality of housing deteriorates)  

> new construction is only a small part of the overall supply  

### housing supply: new housing bs. existing housing  

-  most of the existing housing is supplied through the filtering process:  
    -  housing units trickle down and households move up.  
  
-  if value decreases, rents tend to decrease.  
    -  filter process was fairly evident way of providing affordable housing. this may not be as true anymore.  

>  scarcity increases value of the land, which contributes to rent, while the physical structure of the building may decline.  

-  the supply of new housing depends on the availability of development inputs.  
**Land, labor, materials, and financial services.  

-  How would regulations affect them? How might the development industry respond to this?

E[start construction]

x[regulatory delay #1] --> B
Y[regulatory delay #2] --> D
```

### Housing Supply:  Short-run v.s. Long Run  

-  supply curve in the short run is fixed (vertical supply curve)  
-  in the long run supply is flat (long run)  
-  shifts in demand are much higher frequency, so run up against vertical supply curves (Fixed stock)  

### measuring house supply  
housing supply is measured in a number of ways  
-  rate of new housing construction:  
    -  housing permits  
    -  housing starts  
    -  completions  

Census data on new construction  

-  rate of depreciation of existing housing  
    -  when will housing units stop being used?  
    -  what happens after this?  

> estimates of owner-occupied value depreciate 1.2% per year.  
> estimates of renter-occupied value depreciate 1.4% per year.  

After 50 years or so, housing will only be providing half of it's original value.  

At a certain point, the costs of upkeep and maintenance may exceed the value of the property, so in certain situations there may be abandoned properties.  
-  this happened to detroit and a lot of rust belt cities.  

-  abandoned properties can become contagious  

### Cyclic Nature of new Housing Development  

-  has new housing supply been responsive to housing price change?  
    -  new housing supply = f(housing proce, cost of development inputs)  
    -  basically whether there are profits to be made. if so then you build.  

the long-run price elasticity of new housing production = perdenct change in quantity being produce &div; percentage change in housing price.  

## elastic new housing supply v.s. inelastic new housing supply  

-  people need to consume housing (consumption demand)  
-  but housing is also an asset (investment demand)  
    -  change in interest rates affect investor demand  
    -  when rates are low you can get loans to purchase properties.  
    -  this will increase housing prices.  

-  in elastic supply: housing supply will increase and prices will rise, but only to a small degree.  
    -  pricing will be determined by cost of developments 
-  in inelastic supply: housing supply cannot increase as quickly, and price increases will be much more drastic.  

```mermaid

a[consumption demand] --> b[housing price]
c[investment demand] --> b[housing price] 
d[housing supply] --> |inelastic supply| b[housing price]
b[housing price] --> d[housing supply]
d[housing supply] -- elastic supply --> b[housing price]

```

> what factors affect the price of elasticity of new housing supply?  

### asset price (stock) vs rent (flow)  

$$
p = \sum^T_{t=o}{\frac{R_t = C_t}{(1 + i)^t}}
$$

-  where P is the price of the proper, the present value of future net rental income.  
-  $R_t$ is rent income at time t, 
-  C_t is the maintenance cost ( of the operating cost ) of th eproperty.  
-  i is th einterest rate or discount rate.  
-  t is the list of the asset 

in teh special case where rents and costs are constant over time, and the time horizon is long enouhg:  
$$
P \cong \frac{R - C}{i} 
$$

Here we can call i, the interest rate, as the capitalization rate.  

### data sources on house prices  
-  National Association of Realtors (NAR): median house prices by MSA  
    -  other data available on NAR website.  

### Housing Price  
-  there is no standard unit price observable in the housing market  
-  the housing price/rent we observe measures the **total expenditures** consumers pay for all housing attrivutes n 
-  this also means prices are difficult to compare across locations and time.  
    -  median sale price in one year can differ because different quality houses can sell across different time periods.  

### How can we measure housing price and hence housing quantity?  
-  hedonic price model: enable is to decompose housing prices into measuable attribute prices and quantities.  
-  hedonic price models assume that the market price of a dwelling is hte sum of the prices of the individual components.  
    -  proposed by sherwin rosen (1974)  
-  hedonic equation is a **regression** of expenditures (rents or prices, the dependent variables), on price.  

$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + ... + \beta_n x_n
$$
-  $\beta$ are estimated coefficients, reflecting the iplicit prices of each attribute.  
-  dollars/square foot  
-  bedroom size  
-  building age  
-  etc  

> many housing attribute variables are likely to be related to each other (multicolinearity), but there are adjustments that can be made to address that.  

### selection of independent variables  
-  dwelling strucutre variables:  
    -  whatever characteristic you think matters: # rooms, floor area, structure type, age, materials, other features, etc.  
-  neighborhood characteristics  
    -  rating, school quality, socio-economic characteristics.  
-  location within market
-  **date of transaction**: date of sale also can affect price  

### Hedonic price model:  functional form  

no strong theretical basic cfor choosing any specific functional form. both linear or semi-log functions are used. but semi-log function has advantages over the linear form.  

$$
LnY = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + ... + \beta_n x_n 
$$

-  semi-log functional form allows interpretation of changes in characteristics as percentage changes in price.

### Why repeat sales approach?  

-  hedonic price models require extensive data, but publicly available sales data often do not contain detailed information about unit attributes.  
-  if some important unit characteristics are ommitted, there could be systematic bias in the estimated model.  
-  repeat sales method can help you aboid this data issue. by tracking only the units that have sold.  

-  is it automatically quality-controlled, as long as there have ben no alterations or renovations to the housing unit between the two (or more) transactions.  

### repeat sales approach  

$$
P_1: \text{price at first sale }; P_2 \text{ price at second sale} \\
D_1: \text{date at first sale }; D_2 \text{ date at second sale} \\

LnP_2 = \Beta_0 + \Beta_1 x_1 + ... + \Beta_n x_n + \alpha_2 D_2 \\
LnP_1 = \Beta_0 + \Beta_1 x_1 + ... + \Beta_n x_n + \alpha_1 D_1 \\  
LnP_2 - LnP_1 = \alpha_2D_2 - \alpha+1D_1 \\
Ln\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \alpha_2 D_2 - \alpha_1 D_1 \\
$$

Knowing $Ln\frac{P_2}{P_1}$, we can estimate the $\alpha_2, \alpha_1$ with transaction data.  

Once estimated, we can construct housing price changes for the entire housing market.  

So:  
$$
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = Exp^{\alpha_2D_2-\alpha_1D_1}
$$

### limitations of the repeat sales approach  
-  can only estimate price changes, not levels  
-  assumes the subsample of homes that sold more than once is representative of all home sales during the period.  
-  assume no change in the quality of the housing unit between the two periods where it is sold.  
-  assumes implicit attribute prices are constant over time so that the attribute prices cancel out in the construction of the housing price index.  

### OFHEO Housing Price Index  
OFHEO = Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight  
-  now named Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA)
-  FHFA House Price Index 
-  index developed based on repeat sales  
-  based on transactions involving conforming, conventional mortgages purchased or securitized by fannie mae or freddie mac.  
-  it is based on more that 28.1 million repeat transactions over 29 years.  

### Indicators of local housing affordability: comparative and spatial approach
-  bogdon, amy s. 

-  objectives of the paper:  develop measure to compare affordability across different geographies.  

-  what are the 3 dimensions of housing problems that need to be considered in assessing housing needs?  
    -  overcrowding  
    -  physical adequacy: condition of the unit 
    -  affordability of the unit 

-  what is the state of the housing stock now?  
    -  at the time of the paper (late 1990s), the housing stock was not that old.  
    -  almost 30 years later, the level of replacement of housing stock has not increased, so comparatively the housing stock is older.  

### how to measure housing affordability?  
#### demand side measures: 
percentage of income measure:  
    -  most commonly used is percentage of income spent on housing.
    -  30% of income is a common metric: if a household spends more than 30% of their income on housing, they are considered **cost-burdened**  
-  what are some pros and cons of this measurement:  
    -  measure uses transitory income instead of permanent income.  

Shelter Poverty Measure:  
-  disposable income minus the cost of achieving a minimal standard of non-housing consumption.  

Quality adjusted measure:  
-  number of households where 30% of income would not cover HUD section 8 approved minimum quality standard.  

#### supply side measures:  

vacancy rate:  
-  some people say the natural vacancy rate is aruond 3-4%   

housing affordability mismatch:  
-  ratio of housing units potentially affordable to households earning a certain income to the number of households at that income.  
    -  ratios of less than 1 indicates that there are fewer housing units affordable to households at a specific income range than there are households in that income group.  
-  dollar amount is often the level of housing vouchers using Fair-Market Rent (FMR).  
    -  FMR is average rent for a housing unit of modest quality.  

### housing affordability mismatch  

-  ratio of housing units potentially affordable to households of a certain income range to th4e number of households in htat income range  

$$
\frac{\text{\# of affordable units}}
{\text{\# of households in that income range}}
$$

### National association of realtors (NAR) Housing Affordability Index

-  ratio of 25% of median monthly income to the monthly payment of a conventional mortgage on a median valued house sold.  
-  value of 100 means that by devoting 25% of income to housing, a household of median income has exactly enough income to addord the median house sold.
