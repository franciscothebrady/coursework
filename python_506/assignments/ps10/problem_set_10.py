def board_starship(starship, people):
    """Loops over the passed in people list, which is a list of tuples each representing
    people/passengers on the starship. Each tuple contains a variable assigned to a decoded
    JSON representing a person (in the 0th index) and a boolean indicating their intruder
    status (True, if intruder; False, if just a passenger) (in the 1st index).

    Example:
    [(< person_variable > , < intruder_bool > ), (< person_variable > , < intruder_bool > )]

    Utilizes sequence unpacking to access the 'person' element and the 'intruder' status
    element from the passed in list of tuples.

    Utilizes an if-elif-else statement and compound conditionals to evaluate the truth value
    of the 'intruder' status and check the following conditions:

        (1) If the 'intruder' status element evaluates to True and 'intruder' is already a
            key in the starship dictionary, then it simply appends the 'person' to the
            'intruder' key-value pair.
        (2) If the 'intruder' status element evaluates to True and 'intruder' is not yet a key
            in the starship dictionary, then it assigns a list literal containing the 'person'
            to the new 'intruder' key.
        (3) Otherwise, it appends the 'person' to the 'passengers' key.

    Parameters:
        starship (dict): a dictionary representation of the decoded JSON that contains
                         starship attributes.
        people (list): a list of tuples where, for each tuple, a variable assigned to
                       the decoded JSON representing a person is at the 0th index and a
                       bool value indicating whether they are an intruder is at the 1st index.

    If the conditional statement evaluates to 'True', it assigns the new key
    'primary_docking_bay' with a dictionary literal as its value. The dictionary
    literal has a key of 'docked' and a list literal containing the < prey >
