PUBPOL 510 Strategy Memo Draft

To: Rev. Dr. Wendell Anthony, President, Detroit Branch NAACP
From: Francisco Brady, Policy Analyst, Analysts R Us

Subject: Framing Public Disciplinary Database as Pro-Labor Policy in City's Union Negotiations

Executive Summary:
The NAACP should work with the Detroit mayor and city council to incorporate the creation of a public database of police disciplinary records as part of it's negotiating position for the next round of contract talks with the Detroit Police Officers Association (DPOA). This reform can be advanced
 by framing it as a pro-labor policy that improves working conditions and allows officers to perform their duties more effectively and safely. This framing can overcome union resistance by aligning the reform with frontline officers' interests during contract negotiations with the DPOA. Achieving this reform would represent a significant civil rights victory for the NAACP.

Context:
The current contract with the Detroit Police Officers Association (DPOA) is set to expire in [2027](https://detroitmi.gov/sites/detroitmi.localhost/files/events/2023-11/DPOA%20Contract%202022-2027.pdf), and it is important to start laying the groundwork for negitations now. The Detroit Branch of the NAACP has been on the forefront of the struggle for police accountability and transparency, advocating for reforms to address discriminatory policing practices and misconduct. In this context, it is the right moment for the NAACP to push for the creation of a publicly accessible database of police disciplinary records as part of the city's negotiating position.
The NAACP is prepared to advise the city on how to frame this reform as a pro-labor policy that benefits frontline officers and improves working conditions. This framing can help overcome union opposition and secure the reform as part of the next contract with the DPOA.

Framing as Pro-Labor Policy:
Requiring a publicly accessible database of disciplinary histories would increase transparency and accountability. However, it can be strategically positioned as a reform that directly benefits police labor by:
    1) Addressing Systemic Issues - Tracking disciplinary records would aid the Detroit Police Department (DPD) in identifying patterns of types of misconduct, inadequate training/support, and other types of oversight negatively impacting officers' working environments. This analysis could be used to target resources and training to allow officers to perform their duties more effectively and safely.
    2) Rooting Out Bad Apples - Removing discriminatory or abusive officers who enable misconduct, tarnish the reputation of the profession, and undermine public respect for those serving honorably.
    3) Elevating Professionalism - Promoting a culture of integrity and enhanced standards that elevate officers' standing as trusted public servants worthy of respect and fair compensation.

This framing aligns the reform with frontline officers' interests in a safe, respected working environment supportive of proper conduct. It casts the database as having the potential to improve wages, conditions, and quality of life for dutiful officers upholding professional standards.

Overcoming Police Union Opposition:
While the DPOA will likely oppose any perceived oversight and accountability measures, the mayor and city council can leverage their statutory bargaining authority by making this database policy an established negotiating position, well in advance. In addition, the NAACP believes that framing this position as a pro-labor reform expands potential partnerships and endorsements of the position:

    - Engaging other labor unions/organizations as allies advocating for improved working conditions for officers.
    - Appealing to DPOA leadership's self-interest as this policy ultimately benefits the majority upholding professional standards by removing obstacles to identifying patterns of misconduct, thereby avoiding a Department of Justice Pattern and Practice investigation (Consent Decree), which [just ended in 2014](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-successful-resolution-consent-judgment-involving-detroit-police).
    - Noting how transparency and accountability enhance compensation, safety, and public respect for the policing profession as a whole.
    - Allowing the DPOA input on the database's disciplinary processes and confidentiality provisions to secure buy-in.

By reframing this accountability reform through a labor policy lens focused on improving frontline officers' working environments and identifying recurring issues, the city's negotiators can seek to overcome union opposition. The NAACP should make this pro-labor framing a core strategy alongside public pressure campaigns.

Benefits to the City of Detroit:
Taking this approach in negotiations with the DPOA holds promise for the city of Detroit by:
    - Acting proactively to avoid costly lawsuits, settlements, and federal oversight by gathering data to support identifying misconduct and discrimination in DPD. [Cite Chicago numbers on cost of settlments or find Detroit numbers]
    - Rebuild trust with communities of color and other marginalized groups by demonstrating a commitment to transparency and accountability in policing.
    - Establish Detroit as an innovative pro-labor city that values its police officers' well-being and professionalism, setting a standard for other municipalities to follow.

Benefits to the NAACP:
Achieving this disciplinary record database reform would represent a significant civil rights victory for the NAACP by:

    1) Implementing a key policy goal for police accountability and action against discriminatory misconduct toward minorities.
    2) Raising the stature of the NAACP as an effective advocate able to drive tangible, structural reforms improving civil rights in Detroit.
    3) Energizing the NAACP's local membership and community by demonstrating the organization's power in creating meaningful change.
    4) Positioning the NAACP as a constructive partner able to bring different stakeholders like labor groups together on productive policies.

By taking this labor-focused approach centered on officer working conditions, the NAACP can overcome union opposition while achieving an impactful reform. With strategic framing and public pressure on Detroit's leaders, the NAACP can compel the city to validate their negotiating demand for a disciplinary database that benefits policing and communities alike.
