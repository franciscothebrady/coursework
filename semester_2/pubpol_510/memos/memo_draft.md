## Strategy Memo Meeting

### What policy topic have you chosen, and what kind of change would you like to cause?
Set up a database of police misconduct and violence.
Ideas:
- make it public
- make it available to all police departments
- Allocate funding to maintain and investigate all complaints?

Current efforts to create a database are hampered by:
"Yet the initiative is significantly limited in scope because the U.S. government lacks the authority to require participation from thousands of state, local and tribal police departments, which make up the majority of the nation's law enforcement personnel." (https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2023/dec/19/us-begins-law-officer-database/)

### Why does the government of your country/state OPPOSE this change?
Current efforts the government is making are too limited in scope. The government is not willing to allocate the necessary resources to make the database comprehensive and mandatory for all police departments in the country.

### The strategy memo is about taking advantage of an institution that promotes transparency, accountability, or participation in the policy process.  Which institution will you be writing about?
Police Unions might be a good candidate here. They are also a political organization that can advocate for policy change.

### Who is your stakeholder?  A stakeholder must be an organization (or, in some cases, an individual) that can advocate politically on behalf of the policy change you want.
NAACP is a possible stakeholder.

### Why does your stakeholder approve of this policy change?  What benefit will it lead to for the stakeholder, in addition to the satisfaction of changing the policy?
They have a history of advocating for police reform and have the resources to advocate for a comprehensive database of police misconduct and violence.

### What is the relationship between your stakeholder and the government?
The NAACP is a political organization that can advocate for policy change.

### Why do you think that accountability, transparency, or participation can create the necessary policy change?  If it's necessary but not sufficient, explain some of the other factors important to policy change.
Necessary but not sufficient. If a comprehensive database of police misconduct and violence is created, it will be easier to hold police accountable for their actions. However, state and local governments will also have to make changes in policing and public safety in order for this to work.


### Meeting
misconduct registries
- unions have a role in monitoring the database
- problem: police going from one district to another
- frmaing: younger police vs. older police
-- benefits protections
- police chiefs: more concerned about both misconduct and lack of public support
-- have to answer for budgets and deal with city council, etc and public opinion
-- there has been some success in diversifying police chiefs, but they are management, unions can push back on what they want to do.


- might have to be convince cities to join case by case
- national database is a good idea in theory but also sort of unwieldy

- could get federal money to reward cities that join the database


stakeholders:
- look at more progressive unions
    - restarurant workers in nevada -- look at how they work
- other unions
could also be making the argument that you are a representative within the FOP org ~
- international examples
- nationalized police forces as a comparison example
