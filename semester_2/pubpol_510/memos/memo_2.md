Subject: Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Requests to Advance Asylum Seeker Justice
Date: 2024-04-17

Executive Summary: This memo outlines the potential benefits of utilizing Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to obtain data on the asylum process for individuals in Michigan. By obtaining data from the government on the reasons for refusals, the legal advocates at MIRC can better prepare to assist asylum seekers.
Context:
The Michigan Immigrant Rights Center (MIRC) fights to protect and advance the immigrants' rights in Michigan. MIRC provides legal services and builds capacity through education and training. In doing so, MIRC relies on data to inform their work. In this context, MIRC should consider utilizing Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to demand US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data on the asylum process for individuals in Michigan. FOIA requests allow organizations to request data from any government agency. This data can be used to inform MIRC's work and to advocate for policy changes that advance the rights of asylum seekers.
Successful Use:
In 2020, the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project (ILAP) in Maine, in collaboration with the Maine branch of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) utilized a FOIA request to compel USCIS Offices in Boston and Newark to release data on asylum processing. The offices in Boston and Newark showed an 8% approval rate for asylum applications, compared to the national average of 30%. This data was used to inform ILAP's work with asylum seekers in the state. MIRC can replicate ILAP's success by utilizing FOIA requests to obtain USCIS data on the asylum process for individuals in Michigan. The closest USCIS office to Michigan is in Chicago, and MIRC can request information specific information about procedures at the Chicago office to better understand the asylum process, and what makes a strong case.
Argument Against FOIA Requests:
Some may argue that FOIA requests are time-consuming and may not yield the desired data. However, the potential benefits of obtaining USCIS data on the asylum process for individuals in Michigan outweigh the costs. Information about the process, including refusal rates, processing times, and reasons for refusal, can better prepare the legal advocacy team at MIRC to assist asylum seekers.
