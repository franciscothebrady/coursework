Subject: Rethinking Police Unions: A Potential Ally in Reducing Police Misconduct

Executive Summary: The NAACP should consider engaging with police unions as a potential ally in advocating for police reforms. While historically an opponent, examples exist of unions supporting reform efforts when framed as issues that affect working conditions for frontline officers, and the NAACP can leverage this to build support for meaningful policy change.

Expanding Partnerships to Advocate for Reforms:
In light of increasing police violence, it is crucial that the NAACP explore all avenues and find common cause with outside organizations to build momentum for policies to address police misconduct, racism, and violence. In service of these goals, police unions represent a unique partnership opportunity for the NAACP in advocating for reforms. While historically police unions have been seen as truculent interest groups, there is potential for constructive engagement to leverage their influence in local politics and among the rank and file to create support for meaningful policy change.

Negotiating in Good Faith:
Police unions hold significant sway within police departments and in local politics. Rank-and-file members view unions as their strongest defense against management retaliation, while municipal leaders must engage union leaders while negotiating their collective bargaining agreements (CBAs), which dictate working conditions for police officers. In the struggle to advocate for police reform, the NAACP can create an opportunity for constructive engagement by approaching it as a labor issue. Police violence and misconduct affect the working conditions of officers, and the NAACP can work with police unions to identify problems in the working environment police face while advocating for reforms that improve accountability and safety. The Seattle Police Officers Guild (SPOG) was an important partner in garnering support for implementing mandated reforms after the City entered into a consent decree with the Department of Justice in 2012. The SPOG president supported a measure to include a civilian representative in disciplinary hearings during the negotiation of a new CBA (Fisk & Richardson, 2017).

Addressing Historical Obstruction and Future Opportunities:
Historically, police unions have been seen as obstacles to reform efforts and pressures to outside groups, specifically in the area of police discipline and misconduct. For example, the Chicago bargaining agreement requires a waiting period of 48 hours before an officer accused of misconduct can be interviewed, while Baltimore's CBA allow officers to request that their records be expunged after three years (DiSalvo, 2021). One specific proposal that the NAACP can advocate for is to retain disciplinary records, while negotiating with the union around which parties have access, and for what purposes. This would allow for transparency and accountability while addressing the concerns of the union. In some jurisdictions, police unions will not be easily persuaded to give up these privileges, and other partners may be skeptical of the NAACPâ€™s engagement with police unions. However, given the structure of CBAs, partnering with police unions may be an expedient way to ensure that reforms are implemented and sustained.
