- What else makes organizations independent?

Example:
- federal reserve does not get it's funding from congress (budget)
- has a defined organizational purpose (dual mandate)
- leaders have long term appointments (personnel)
- stakeholders can depend on the organization to be independent of political influence

-- These are all ways to make an organization independent, not just the Central Bank.

#### Association dependence on the government
- Personnel decisions: if you need to be a member of the association to do business in that country
- budget: if the government funds the association
- organizational purpose/mandate: if there is an external mandate that the association must follow

### interpenetration by the state
- interpenetration: "merging" of state and non-state actors

1. Associations can be created by the state
    - Example: All China Women's Federation
2. Associations are represented in the legislature (often through "at large" ballots filled by a "party list")
    - at large ballots: when a party wins a proportion of seats, they can fill those seats with members who do not represent a specific district, but instead represent particular interests.
3. Associations are represented in the executive branch (often through "revolving door" appointments)
4. Associations are represented in the judicial branch (often through appointment process)
5. Associations are part of a formal consultative process
6. Associations support candidates with money and/or electioneering
7. Associations support issues by lobbying
    - this includes expertise

### regulation by the state
how the state affects orgs
- legal status and rights
- funding structure
- membership
- reporting
- expertise

to what extent can organizations function as non-affiliated groups? To what extent does affiliation give them power?

### Bonus Topic: Foreign Influence
- should domestic associations be allowed to accept alliances/money/expertise from foreign countries/governments?
- should international associations be allowed to create chapters/subsidiaries in countries other than the one they are headquartered in?
