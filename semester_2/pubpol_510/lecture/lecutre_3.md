- sometimes just sent to congress, sometimes broadcast
- timing has varied between December to February
- due to "Equal time" rules (FCC), opposition messages started in 1966

### take care clause
- congress creates a program and appropriates money for it; but executive branch writes rules, spends money, evaluates results.
- if the president has not "faithfully executed" a law, the president can be sued.

### is the president/executive branch:
malfeasance -
- engaging in corruption?
- targeting spending politically?
policy disagreement -
- spending money that congress wants it to spend?
- spending money that congress has appropriated for a different purpose?
- implementing laws that the president does not agree with?
- creating programs/taking action that congress did not authorize?

### did the president faithfully execute the law?
- dhs creates a program, "deferred action for childhood arrivals" (DACA), allowing undocumented youth to register their undocumented status and upon doing so, to receive the witholding of deportation and employment authorization.
- it bases this program on prosecutorial discretion, this is the leeway given to dhs agents to determine whether undocumented immingrants should be deported and if not what should happen instead.
