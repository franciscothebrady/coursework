### Censorship
Quiqing Tai: "Dynamic and Diversified" censorship
- banning/deleting
    - topics that are always or at certain times cannot be covered
- restricting
    - subjects that cannot be discussed at particular times -- around holidays or national anniversaries
- encouraging
- variation across types of media (press vs. internet) and central/local government

> Censorship as editorial judgement

### What kind of information do readers want to see?
two studies:
1. study of content on reddit after hurricane sandy:
    - highest scoring: human interest stories, "perspecitve-based citizen journalism"
    - lower scoring: professional news content
2. study of wechat groups in the united states:
    - most covered: affirmaive action, census, unauthorized immigration, race relations
    - less covered: jobs, healthcare, economy
    - stories gained credibility by repetition/forwarding
    - weak-tie social networks more responsible than technology/algorithms
