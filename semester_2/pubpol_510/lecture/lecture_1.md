### politics of public policy

focus on set of practices that are authoritarian practices:
- make it difficult for people to assert control or demand transparency from government 
> try to avoid language of authoritarian countries, because the focus will be more on institutions.
- sometimes there are legitimate rationales for authoritarian practices (less transparency or accountability)

attempt to identify features that can be identified across any political system
- authoritarian practices are not unique to authoritarian countries

semester project:
- select a country or state/province/organization (with approval)
- follow throughout the course
