### protecting individual rights through government structures
- logic of each institutions tells us about the kinds of rights that might be protected by the institution

### government structures names in discussion
- constitutionalism: federal v. unitary systems
    - unitary: every level of government gets its power from the central government
        - means central gov't can dictate much more to local gov't
        - most countries in the world are unitary systems
    - federal: different levels of gov't have their own sources of power (usually laid out in a constitution)
        - 9th and 10th amendments: any powers not reserved for the federal gov't are reserved for the states.
        - offers a restraint on the power of the central gov't
        - US adopted a federal system to protect the institution of slavery
        - in theory also to protect the rights of the states
        - tribal gov't: also sovereign. came from treaties between separate tribes and the US gov't
- judicial review
    - courts review both actions and legislation
    - judges look at the law as it was written and explain what the law means and how it can be applied.
- separation of powers
    - different branches of government have distinct responsibilities
       - example: asylum seekers at texas border. supreme court rules that federal gov't has final authority over the border and not the state in enforcing immigration law.
- checks and balances
    - one branch of government can be overruled/checked by another
    - example: president can veto a bill passed by congress, but congress can override the veto with a 2/3 majority vote
    - example: debate in israel over the role of the israeli supreme court vs. the prime minister

### how do these structures protect individual rights?
- constitutionalism
    - name and implied rights
    - example of named right: 2nd amendment (right to bear arms)
    - example of implied right: right to privacy
- judicial review
    - rights of individuals vs. rights of groups
        - press rights are important and distinct from individual rights
        - there is an expectation from US history that the press will keep the government accountable
    - 19th amendment: freedom to vote should not be abridged on the basis of gender.
    - 26th amendment: the right to vote of citizens of the US who are 18 years of age or older shall not be denied or abridged by the US or by any state on account of age.
- separation of powers:
    - selection of personnel fosters distinct attentiveness to rights
- judiciary
    - us context: not elected (for supreme court), so less beholden to public opinion.
