### Roundtable Discussions

1. Public Comment in the United States
    - Pro: Democractic, allows people with lived experience to comment on issues directly affecting their lives.
    - Con: Prone to issues and industry capture. ISPs and other industries have been known to flood the public comment process with fake comments.
2. Public Comment in the European Union
    - Pro: More democratic, more transparent, more accountable.
    - Con: EU Laws and regulations are complex, not accessible enough, and people don't participate at a high enough level in the public comment process. Too technocratic and too much emphasis on experts and expertise. Private comment period is closed to the public.
