### Discussion: Saudi Arabia Movements to allow Women Driving
- organization: large external pressures from international organizations to allow women permission to drive
- policy: allow women to drive
- response: protests, with a large number of arrests
- response: some limited reforms, but the people arrested are still in jail

### China: Domestic Violence
- What makes the organization to address domestic violence different from the organization to address sexual harassment in China
    - domestic violence is seen as a private issue, and the government is more willing to address complaints about domestic violence.
    - part of the campaign happened over social media and that precipitated the participation of the All China Women's Federation (ACWF)
    - Institutionalized organization steps in and is willing to work with activists and propose legislation (that is palatable to the party)

Cooptation: the process of absorbing or assimilating members of a group into a larger group, often under the guise of offering them a voice or representation.
- instead of substantive policy change, you can end up with symbolic representation.

A central dilemma of authoritarian governments:
- monitor public opinion
- sometimes respond to it
- or sometimes repress it
- depending on how much you can control the public opinion on it
- this is one of the goals of cooptation
    - the policy demands are not the scary thing, it's the organization that is scary
