### Chinese Democracy

Elections are largely at the neighborhood level.

US:
- lots of information available on candidates and positions.
- majority of positions only have one person running for them. (uncontested)
- difficult to challenge incumbent.
- In the US the idea of the contested election is not an outlier.

What kind of representation do elections provide?
- most people can't name their state legislator
- what is the job of those legislators?
    - at the state level: their job is being responsive to the people who elected them
- representation is happening primarily because of the responsiveness of the elected officials, NOT because of the elections.

> Are we more interested in responsive government or elected government?

Can you name your local legislator verus some state and national legislator?
- part of this is because of press consolidation and the decline of local news.
- there were periods of american history where americans were more informed about their local politics.

### Political Machines 
How do regular rotational elections transform into political machines or dynasties?
- once elected, local politicians attain the ability ot bring home goods and services to their constituents.
- what was once local responsive governance can become a spoils system/quid pro quo/my vote for your bridge.
