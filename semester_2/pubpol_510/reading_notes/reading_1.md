1. Rise of authoritarian or qausi-authoritarian leaders across the world
    - Modi (India), Putin (Russia), Xi (China), Erdogan (Turkey), Duterte (Philippines), Orban (Hungary), Trump (US)
    - political scientists lack the vocabulary and tools to identify and understand these characterizations
    - "have little to say on how to evaluate what they do once in office"
    - This can apply to organizations as well, such as the IMF, WTO, or the NSA
    - In academic literature, "authoritarian" refers to:
        - a regime that does not organize free and fair elections (comparative politics)
        - authoritatian refers to a psychological profile characterized by a preference for order, heirarchy, and a fear of outsiders (political psychology)
    - instead of characterizing a regime as authoritarian, political scientists should define and operationalize authoritarian practices.
    - this enables a classification of the "authoritarian-ness" of a regime
    - authoritarian practices: patterns of action that sabotage accountability to people over who a political ator exerts control, or their representatives, by means of secrecy, disinformation and disabling voice.
    - These practices constitute a threat to democratic processes

2. disciplinary blinkers
    - Case study: Venezuela
        - 2006: Chavez wins election
        - 2012: Chavez wins re-election amid harassment of opposition, antagonism towards the work of civil society and activists.
        - 2013: Chavez dies, Maduro wins election, amid electoral violence
        - 2015: Maduro dissolves national assembly
        - According to various indicators, Venezuela is a democracy, and a personalized dictatorship (2016 on),
        - Others characterize it as a slow transition to full authoritarianism by 2016.
    - Case study: Policy of rendition by US CIA
        - "It would be peculiar to label the Bush administration an authoritarian regime because of the rendition programme."
        - "And should we ask only whether the rendition policy was subject to oversight by representatives of the American people?"
    - Authoritarianism is a negative category without a definition of it's own.
    - Excessive focus on elections
    - assumptions that authoritarianism is a structural phenomenon only applicable to nation-state level
3. Vacuum at the core
    - Linz 1975: authoritarianism as a shortfall of democracy
    - Schumpeter or Dahl: lack of "free competition for a free vote"
4. Beyond Elections
    - categorizations of democracies and thus not authoritarian states rely on elections
    - existing analyses "do not begin to test whether citizens are actually enabled to influence policy or organize distribution."
    - "democracy scholars have long ceased to identify democracies merely by the presence of free and fair elections, and authoritarianism scholars should cease to identify authoritarianism merely by their absence."
    - "we should look for an active practice of disrupting or sabotaging accountability, rather than absence of free and fair elections, as the core feature of authoritarianism. Such sabotage will manifest itself in political practices, not necessarily in constitutional arrangements."
5. Authoritarian practices:
    - accountability is a relationship between an actor and a forum, in which the actor is answerable to the forum for its actions or inactions.
    - accountability helps to constitute non-domination.
    - authoritarian practices enable domination
    - sabotage of accountability is not the same as a lack of accountability mechanisms
    - "a definition of authoritarian practices should (a) be able to approach authoritarianism as a substantive phenomenon, rather than just a shortfall of democracy; (b) step away from elections as the primary touchstone; and (c) capture the character of authoritarianism when no longer necessarily embodied in and exercised by national governments of states alone.
    - "I define an authoritarian practice as a pattern of actions, embedded in an organized context, sabotaging accountability to people (‘the forum’) over whom a political actor exerts control, or their representatives, by disabling their access to information and/or disabling their voice."
