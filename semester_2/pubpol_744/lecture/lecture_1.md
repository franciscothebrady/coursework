### politics vs policy analysis 

- all views that are respectful of others are encouraged.  
- economists separate out:  
    - policy goals 
    - the facts of policy analysis 
    - the weighing of various costs and benefits under uncertainty.  

E.g. There is a lot of debate about the minimum wage. 

### what is public finance  
- PF is the study pof the role of the government in the economy  
- covers any way in which the gov't alters the economy  
- PF digs into the economic consequences of public policy choices 
- if you do anything with public policy in your carreer these tools are essential.  

### four questions fo public finance 

1.  when should the gov't intervenee in the economy?
2. how might the gov't intervene?
3. what is the effect of those interventions on economic outcomes?
4. why do gov'ts choose the interventions they do?

### when should the gov't intervene in the economy?

- Economics generall y presumes that markets deliver efficient outcomes, so why should gov't do anything? 
- what is efficient? do we always want efficient? 
    - even if the market is well-functioning, an efficient outcome may not be socially desirable.
    - redistribution is a reason for government intervention.
- Even when you want efficiency, markets don't always deliver 
    - market failures: a problem that causes the market economy to deliver an outcome that does not maximize efficiency 

### how might the gov't intervene?

- tax or subsidize private sales or purchases
    - use the price mechanism, changing the price of a good to encourage or discourage use.
    - taxes raise the price for private sales or purchases that are overproduced
- restrct or mandate pricate sale of purchase
    - quotas restrict private sale of goods or overproduced
    - mandactes require purchase of private goods that are underproduced
- public provision
    - the government can provide the good or service directly
- public financing of private provision 
    - government pays, but private firms provide the good or service

### what are the effects of alternative interventions on economic outcomes?

- intervnetions have direct and indirect effects
- direct effects: the effects of govt interventions that are predicted if individuals did not change their behavior in response to their interventions. 
    - with 6.9 million unemployed people, providing unemployment insurance covers 6.9 million people.
- indirect effects: the effects of government intervention that arise only because individuals change their behavior in response to the interventions 
    - if people don't work because of unemplyment insruacnce, many more people may end up getting benefits 
    - policy arguments are often abvout the indirect effects, but can also be about the direct effects.  

### why do governments do wqhat they do? 
- governments do not always choose efficient or socially desirable outcomes 
- governments face enormous challenges in figuring out what the public wants and how to choose policies that match those wants. 
- political economy is the study of how the political process produces decisions that affect individuals and the economy.

### critical thniking 
goal: sharpen critical thinking skills

### policy considerations
- what are out objectives?
- wehat are the costs of each action or inaction?
- what are we risking and what are we willing to risk>
- what solution best meets the desired objectives?

### is there a role for public policy? 
- should the gov't promote occupational safety and health (foro example)
- if so how? 
    - information and disclosure
    - regulation
    - fines/legal action
- lots of tools, each can get to the same outcome in terms of safety and health, but each has different costs and benefits.
