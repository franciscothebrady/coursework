### intro
- phd at cornell
- research interests: income inequality, education policy

### course motivation 
scenario: free college 
consensus: more college is good
what is the motivation behind such a policy? 
from a public policy perspective, why might we want to implement free college?
- maybe the state wants to increase the number of college graduates
- college degree holders earn more money, and higher earners pay more taxes
- deindustrialization in michigan lead to decline in jobs and population

### more education --> higher earnings 
- making tuition free would encourage more people to go to college
- higher earnings --> higher tax revenue

### one year from now 
- you are working for the governors office
- the governor wants an analysis of the free college policy

## the key number you need 
- how much would ht eincome of the average high school graduate increase if they were to get more schooling? 
Note: this is a difficult question to answer in a causal way.

### appraoch 1: sinmple comparison by educ. level
- median usual weekly earnings: 
    - phd: 2,083
    - HS diploma: 853
take the raw difference: 2,083 - 853 = 1,230
- higher educated workers are also more likely to be employed

### problems with simple comparison
- why might this comparison overstate the return to education?
    - people who end up going to college have some characteristics that are associated with higher earnings, even if they don't go to college.
- why might this comparison understate the return to education?

### key question to ask
- why do schooling levels differ between people? 

### approach 2: "control for stuff" by comparing between groups 
- compare earnings by education within specific groups of people 
    - average weekly earnings: black men aged 35 - 45 who live in mid-atlantic 
    - average weekly earnings: white women in mid-atlantic
    - average weekly earnings: hispanic men in south

### approach 3: "control for more stuff" by going to twinsburg, OH
- find twins who differ in years of schooling
- compare their earnings
- this is a natural experiment
concerns with this approach:
- twins might have different interests, and choose much different earning occupations
- lots of twins might have the same amount of education

### approach 4
- school attendance laws require students to start school by a certain age (~6) and stay in school until a certain age (~16)
- strategy: compare wages of thsoe born earlier in the year to those born later in the year 
    - those born in the early part of the year obtain less schooling because they can drop outof school earlier than those who are born at the end of the year (depends on state cut-off dates).
- compare by season of birth (born in 1st quarter vs. 3rd/4th quarter)

this is the approach that angrist and krueger (1991) use in their paper.
note:
- only used men
- compared differences in earnings between high school graduates only 
- relies on the fact that season of birth is essentially randomly assigned
    - this is not exactly random
- people born a month apart are not systematically different from each other.

### the bottom line 
- lots of different approaches for getting to teh same number 
- all approaches require some type of assumptions 
- some approaches/assumptions more credible than others

- the ideal setting: randomized, controlled trial (RCT)
    - randomize who gets a "treatment" (e.g. more school)
- the reality: observational data
    - people make decisions and then we observe their outcomes
