### Service Sector Unionization  

In your new job as policy analyst for the union SEIU (Service Employees International Union), you are helping to craft a memo that your boss will use to tout the benefits of unionization to potential new service-sector members. You will need to use multivariable regression in order to estimate the relationship between unionization and wages, holding other factors constant.  

### Data  

The dataset `unions.dta` contains data from the Current Population Survey. It contains a random subsample of 1,000 currently employed participants in the "Earner Study" supplement to the CPS who worked last year in a service industry (retail, health care, education, personal services, and government). The dataset contains nine variables:  
  
#### 1. Estimate the relationship between hourly wages and union status using bivariate regression. The results of this regression will be column 1 in your Table 1.  

```s/

```



##### a. What is the population regression function (or equation) you have estimated? [do not use Y and X for variable namesâ€”write in the variable names]  

The population regression for column 1:  

$$
\text{Hourly Wage}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Union}_i + u_i
$$
    
##### b. Interpret the coefficient on union status. [Hint: since union status is a binary variable, it does not make sense to say "A one-unit increase in union status"]  

The coefficient on union status is 5.324, this is, on average, the difference of means in hourly wages of those in a union, compared to those not in a union. This indicates that on average, union status is associated with an increase in hourly wages of $5.32.
    
##### c. Interpret the constant.  

The constant is 15.285. This is the average wage associated with non-union workers.  

##### d. Test the null hypotheses that the coefficient on union status in the population regression function is zero.  

To test the null hypothesis we can calculate the test statistic and compare that to the critical value at the 95% level of confidence:  

$$
t = \frac{5.324295}{.7268916} = 7.32
$$  

The absolute value of the test statistic exceeds the critical value of 1.96, so we can reject the null hypothesis that the true coefficient on `union` is equal to 0.


##### e. How much of the variation in wages can be explained by union status?  

Using the $R^2$ output, the union status explains around ~5.45% of the variation of wages.  
    
#### 2. After your causal inference training, you are reluctant to interpret the bivariate relationship between wages and union status as the causal effect of unionization given all the possible confounders. One variable you are particularly worried about is age.  

##### a. Given this possibility, explain how the omission of a control for age might bias your estimates of the effect of union status, using the OVB framework.  

It is possible age is related to the outcome variable, since in general workers earn more as they get older and more experienced, this would be a positive correlation. The age variable may also be related to the union membership variable, since union members tend to be older, this is also a positive correlation. Since we only included union membership in the initial model, the coefficient estimate will be too large. 

Both of these factors could bias the estimate on union membership downward.  [BOTH GOING IN THE SAME DIRECTION SO POSITIVE BIAS]
[THE BIAS IS POSITIVE BECAUSE WITHOUT AGE WE WILL ASSIGN TOO MUCH TO UNION]
[AGE IS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH BOTH]
[LOOK AT ]

##### b. Now regress hourly wage on union status and age. The results of this regression will be column 2 in your Table 1. Interpret the coefficient on age. Please discuss the magnitude and the significance.  

The coefficient on age is .121, and it is statistically significant. The interpretation is that an additional year of life is associated with .12 cents in hourly wages on average, holding union membership constant.  
 
##### c. Discuss the change in magnitude and statistical significance of the coefficient on union status from column 1 to 2. Was the change consistent with what you predicted above, in part (a)?  

[WE KNOW THERE'S A POSITIVE BIAS]

##### d. Given your answer to (c), what is the sign of the correlation between hourly wage and age? What about age and union status?  

[IS THIS ENOUGH]
The correlation between hourly wages and age is weakly positive. The correlation between age and union status is also weakly positive.  [WE KNOW BECAUSE OF THE POSITIVE COEFFICIENTS ON THE OUTPUT: ]
[WE KNOW 1) HOURLY WAGE AND AGE == +
AND WE KNOW AGE AND UNION == + 
BECAUSE WE KNOW THERE'S A POSITIVE BIAS]
  
#### 3. You recall from your days as a union organizer that you would specifically target employers that had a lot of workers so that you could organize the most people in one place. You also recall hearing that wages tend to vary with firm size, though you cannot remember the direction. You figure you should control for firm size too, just in case. Now regress hourly wage on union status, age, and empsize, reporting your results in the table, in column 3 of Table 1.  

##### a. What happens to the coefficient on union status once age and employer size are included in the regression? Explain in terms of omitted variable bias.  

[5.32 VS. 4.BLAH]
[IN TERMS OF OVB: EMPSIZE MUST BE CORRELATED W HOURLY WAGE]
[EMPSIZE COULD BE POSITIVE WITH BECAUSE COEFF ON UNION WENT DOWN]
[JUST RIFF ON REASONS]
  
##### b. Do larger firms pay more or less, conditional on union status and age?  

[IS THIS ENOUGH]
The coefficient on firm size is positive and significant, but small, meaning that larger firms are associated on average with slightly higher wages.

#### 4. Next, let's consider an additional factor related to employment and wages that might bias the union coefficient. Please include indicators for the industry of employment (`ind_retail`, `ind_personal`, `ind_health`, `ind_educ`, and `ind_govt`; use `ind_govt` as the reference category). This will be column 4.  
  
##### a. Which industry has the highest wages? How can you tell?  

[IS THIS ENOUGH]
All of the other industries have lower wages than those associated with government. All of the signs on the coefficients for industry are negative, indicating that on average those wages are lower than the reference category of government wages, holding union status, age, and firm size constant. []


##### b. Discuss the changes in magnitude and statistical significance on the coefficient on union status between columns 3 and 4.

[COEFF ON UNION DECREASES. STAT SIGNIFIANT]

##### c. What are the consequences of not accounting for industry of employment when regressing hourly wages on union status? Explain in terms of omitted variable bias.  

[CORRELATED WITH WAGES AND UNION STATUS, WOULD BIAS COEFFS ON UNION.]

##### d. On average, how much would the model predict each of these people to earn:  
###### i. A 40-year old unionized worker in a firm of 500 people, working in the health industry?  

[19.982]

###### ii. A 55-year old non-unionized government worker in a firm of 1000?  
[21.551]

##### e. Test whether the industry variables are jointly significant, controlling for the other variables included in column 3. Report the F-statistic and the p-value and explain in 1-2 sentences the conclusion of the test.  

```s
test ind_retail ind_educ ind_health ind_personal
```

[REJECT THE NULL THAT none of the industry variables included are significantly diff frmo govt, holding everything esle constant]
```
. test ind_educ  ind_health ind_personal  ind_retail

 ( 1)  ind_educ = 0
 ( 2)  ind_health = 0
 ( 3)  ind_personal = 0
 ( 4)  ind_retail = 0

       F(  4,   992) =   22.52
            Prob > F =    0.0000
```

#### 5. When you sit down with your boss to share your analysis, she voices two concerns:  

"This can't be the whole story since you haven't controlled for sex. Women make less than men, so you have to account for sex."  
  
  Since you do not have variables on sex in your dataset, you can't directly address this concern by adding it to the regression. However, you are able to find some information about wages and unionization rates by sex from another source (shown in table below).  
  
|                     | Men   | Women |
|---------------------|-------|-------|
| Average Hourly Wage | 17.65 | 15.36 |
| Fraction Unionized  | 0.175 | 0.174 |
<br>

##### a. What is the consequence of failing to control for sex in your regressions above? (i.e. is there omitted variable bias?)  
[exists when variable controlled for affects both x and y]
[gender does not affect percent of unionization (not )]


##### b. Describe at least two other factors that you think may be important to control for. For each, state what you anticipate the sign of the correlation between the omitted variable and hourly wages and between the omitted variable and union status to be. How does omitting each of these variables from the bivariate regression of question 1 affect the coefficient on union status?  

[years of education]
- associated w/ higher wages (positive)
- could underestimate by leaving out 

[location: urban/rural dummy]
- union jobs in rural areas might
