<h3 id="part-i-estimating-and-interpreting-fixed-effects">Part I:
Estimating and interpreting fixed effects</h3>
<p>Approximately 40%-50% of driving fatalities occur in accidents in
which at least one of the drivers involved has been drinking. There are
approximately 40,000 highway traffic fatalities annually in the United
States, so perhaps 20,000 of these deaths are alcohol-related. In the
U.S., highway laws are under the jurisdiction of the states, and states
have adopted different strategies to address the problem of drunk
driving. In this problem set, you will use data (drunkdri.dta) on
traffic death rates by state for 1982-1988 to evaluate the effectiveness
of some of these laws.</p>
<h3 id="output">Output</h3>
<p>This assignment has you run a total of six regressions. You should
put the results from all of your regressions into a single table (which
you can create in excel or word or another spreadsheet software, see
Table 7.1 in the S&amp;W book for suggested format). The table does not
need to display the estimated coefficients for any of the state and year
fixed effects, but it should note which specifications include year
and/or state fixed effects and should display coefficient estimates and
standard errors for all of the other covariates. Each regression output
should be presented in a different column within the table.</p>

[Regression 1, Raw correlation]: Regress the vehicle fatality rate
against the beer tax and the minimum legal drinking age. Interpret the
coefficients on the beer tax and minimum legal drinking age.</h5>
<p>The coefficient on beertax is positive and significant, implying that
holding the legal drinking age constant, a percentage increase in the
tax on beer is associated with an increase of .51 in the Vehicle
Fatality Rate per 10,000. [Range is from .82 to 4.21, sd .57, so this is
big-ish].<br />
The coefficient on the minimum legal drinking age is negative and
significant. This implies that an increasing the minimum legal drinking
age by one year is associated with a .95 decrease in the Vehicle
Fatality Rate per 10,000, holding beer taxes constant.</p>

[Regression 2, control for “stuff”]: Add to the previous regression the
percent of the population living in dry counties, average miles driven,
the percent of drivers aged 15-24, and the per capita income in the
state. This set of variables will be referred to for the rest of the
problem set as the “state control variables.”</h5>
<h5
id="d-do-the-coefficients-on-the-beer-tax-and-drinking-age-change-substantively-from-b-to-c-if-so-explain-why.">d)
Do the coefficients on the beer tax and drinking age change
substantively from (b) to (c)? If so, explain why.</h5>
<p>Yes. The coefficient on beer tax and drinking age both decrease
substantively.<br />
The coefficient on beer taxes goes from 0.508 (significant at the 1%
level) to 0.141 and loses significance at any conventional level. This
suggests that the first regression suffered from omitted variable bias,
and that including the state control variables helped to account for
some of the differences in Vehicle Fatality Rates (VFR) that were not
captured previously.<br />
The coefficient on minimum legal drinking age also decreases, however it
is still significant (at the 5% level). This suggests again that
including the state control variables helps to account for omitted
variable bias, and that the naive regression was over-attributing some
of the effects to minimum legal drinking age.</p>

Interpret the coefficients on the beer tax and minimum legal drinking
age in the previous regression. Do the coefficients on the beer tax and
minimum legal drinking age change substantively from 2(a) to 2(b)? Why
or why not?</h5>
<p>The coefficient on beer tax in the full sample regression is 0.095,
and is not significant. This decreases to 0.083 in the year fixed
effects model, and is also not significant.<br />
The coefficient on minimum legal drinking age in the full sample
regression is -0.008, and is not significant. This increases to -0.028
in the year fixed effects model, but is also not significant.<br />
These changes are small and do not affect the significance of the
coefficients. It’s possible that some omitted variables that vary over
time but not across states do not affect the vehicle fatality rate.</p>

[Regression 5, add state and year fixed effects]: Now, add to the
regression in 2(b) a set of state fixed effects. Do the coefficients on
the beer tax and minimum legal drinking age change substantively Why or
why not?</h5>
<p>Yes, the coefficients on beer tax and minimum legal drinking age
change substantively. For beer tax, the coefficient increases in
magnitude, and changes direction, from 0.083 in the year fixed effects
model to -0.571 in the state-year fixed effects model. The coefficient
is also significant at the 5% level, compared to not significant in the
previous model. This suggests that time-invariant state-level factors
were not being included in the model, resulting in an underestimate of
the impact of beer taxes in the year fixed effects model.<br />
For minimum legal drinking age, the coefficient increases from -0.027 to
0.004, however it is still not significant. [ADD REASON WHY]</p>

Write a paragraph in which you discuss whether you can confidently place
a causal interpretation on the analysis you have undertaken. In your
answer, discuss the biases that could threaten the analysis and how the
control variables, year effects and state effects each attempt to deal
with these biases.</h5>
<p>I don’t think I would be confident in a causal interpretation for
this analysis. I could be confident about claiming a strong association
between VFR and the beer tax, but there are other things that could
potentially impact the vehicle fatality rate. This is the reason for
including the state control variables (% of dry counties, average miles
driven, % of young drivers, and income). Leaving these out, as we saw,
positively biased the coefficients on both beer tax and driving age
upwards, overestimating their impacts.<br />
The inclusion of year fixed effects is to account for any time trends
that could affect all of the states in the analysis, like a recession or
new national law related to driving.<br />
Including state fixed effects attempts to control for any differences
across states, and including them produced significant changes magnitude
and direction of the coefficients.</p>

<p>The pre- and post groups are the cohorts of children in households
with at least one American Indian parent that received cash transfers,
with the younger children acting as the treated group (pre), and the
older children serving as the before treatment group (post). The
comparison group is children in households with no American Indian
parent in the household that were not treated with cash transfers.</p>

What are the main assumptions the authors are making with their
difference-in-differences strategy? Give two examples of how these

paragraph).</h4>
<p>Parallel Trends: The authors assume that macroeconomic conditions are
similar across the groups being differenced. They show that labor market
conditions are not statistically different across the groups. An example
of how this could be violated is if there were employment opportunities
that only tribal members were eligible for, which could explain
increased incomes in excess of the cash transfer payments.<br />
