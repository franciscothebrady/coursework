Response:
- From [this 2016 TNR article "Twilight of the Nudges"](https://newrepublic.com/article/138175/twilight-nudges): "Do nudges preserve freedom of choice for everyone, or only for those people who are resourced to exercise that freedom?"
- Hausman and Welch argue that Thaler and Sunstein err in their definitions of libertarian and of paternalism. They take issue with the nudges because: "... rational persuasion respects both individual liberty and the agent’s control over her own decision-making, while, in contrast, deception, limiting what choices are available or shaping choices risks circumventing the individual’s will."
- Persad notes that the points of argument made in favor of administrative "choice architecture" can just as easily be made to defend what many see as draconian restrictions when placed in the context of abortion access. Waiting periods, mandatory counseling, and other "nudges" are seen as paternalistic and coercive by many.
- In Republic of Choosing, William Simon reviews Sunstein's post-administration book, which defends libertarian paternalism and it's application during the Obama Administration. Simon notes that although Sunstein is right that the administration encouraged taking advantage of behavioral insights when implementing some of it's major policy wins, nudges were not at the centerpiece of many of them. The Affordable Care Act (ACA/Obamacare) was famous for restricting choice, specifically in the form of not allowing people the freedom to remain uninsured, which is counter to the libertarian paternalist views Sunstein and Thaler promoted. In assessing the political effectiveness of nudges, which Sunstein and Thaler claim can be popular to affiliates of any party, Simon disagrees, and laments Sunstein's attempts to woo intransigent libertarians at the expense of convincing the voting public that liberal ideas and policies could solve major problems, like unemployment and inequality.

Overview (from Canvas):
Monday's class will take a look at a very influential policy idea, Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler’s idea of "nudging", which they first introduced in an essay titled "Libertarian Paternalism is Not an Oxymoron

(As you’ll remember from last month’s class on benefit cost analysis, during the Obama administration, Sunstein was the director of the federal Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. Thaler received the Nobel prize in economics a few years ago.)

The idea of “libertarian paternalism” remains central for Sunstein and Thaler. It's a deliberately paradoxical idea: “Libertarianism” and “paternalism” are usually viewed as diametrical opposites. Sunstein and Thaler draw from the field of behavioral economics to try to show how policy can both respect an individual’s liberty and promote her welfare.  (William Simon's essay provocatively argues that Sunstein and Thaler have conceded too much to libertarians.)

Their argument rests on research findings that demonstrate how actual human decision-making often deviates substantially from the model of human decision-making assumed by classical economics. Human beings make predictable mistakes when we evaluate evidence, and our decisions are influenced by contextual factors that ought to be irrelevant. By employing these quirks in human psychology to promote individual welfare, policymakers (and private firms as well for that matter) can do a lot of good in the world. Or so Sunstein and Thaler argue.

We want to discuss the ethical dimensions of Sunstein and Thaler's agenda. According to them, behavioral economics identifies powerful new tactics for influencing human behavior. To what ends should these tactics be put? What limits should restrain their use? Where is the line between harmless “nudges” and illegitimate manipulation? These are the core questions that our discussion will consider on Wednesday. Sunstein and Thaler themselves consider them in parts of their book (you can find further relevant thoughts from Sunstein in  his recent books The Ethics of Influence

To ground our discussion, it will be helpful to focus on specific examples of nudges. Several are described in your readings, and the old Nudge blog

The excerpt from Govind Persad's article describes several especially controversial nudges designed to influence women's decisions about whether or not to have an abortion (see also the counseling and waiting period requirements that many states have enacted

Links to an external site., which are sometimes characterized as nudges). I will also ask our kickstarters to identify some additional concrete examples of nudging to bring into our discussion. By exploring concrete examples of what nudging looks like in practice, we can begin to think through when, if ever, nudging is most promising, most frightening, etc.

In addition to the specific questions raised by Sunstein and Thaler’s Nudge agenda, the kinds of interventions they describe raise a more general topic related to individual liberty. There are a lot of tools government can use to accomplish public goals: Not just prohibitions and mandates, but also incentives, public information campaigns, manipulations of choice architecture, etc. The prohibitions and mandates raise obvious concerns about personal freedom. To what extent do the other kinds of policy interventions implicate concerns about liberty? Under what conditions are they legitimate? Do the criteria for justified incentives, choice architecture, public information campaigns, etc. differ from the criteria for justified legal prohibitions that are at the center of debates about liberalism?
