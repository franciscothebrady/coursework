Hinman - The Ethics of Consequences (excerpt)
- Defines utilitarianism as a philosophy that is concerned with maximizing the best outcome
- reducing decision points to mathematical comparison between hedons (units of good feeling or happiness) and dolors (units of bad feeling or unhappiness)
- Then using these summations to make decisions or actions
- There's two type of utilitarian thinking:
    - act utilitarianism: the right action is the one that produces the best outcome
    - rule utilitarianism: the right action is the one that conforms to the best rule
    - the difference is that act utilitarianism is concerned with the outcome of the action, while rule utilitarianism is concerned with the outcome of the rule
- Some argue for a blend of the two, but if all rules have exception, that just becomes act utilitarianism

Bentham - Principles of Morals and Legislation
- principle of utility: to promote happiness in all actions and avoid unhappiness or displeasure
- utility: property in an object to produce pleasure or prevent pain
