## Reading notes

#### Home Visiting in the Early Years: Policy and Program Design Decisions. Douglass R. Powell. Young Children, 1990

- Limited amount of evidence pointing to program effectiveness.
- lots of variation in program content and methods
- single-focus: primarily focused on the child
- multiple-focus: focused on the child, parent, and family functioning
- ethical dilemmas: who is the client (parent/child) and what is the role of the home visitor?
- deficit framework: tends to focus or assume parents and families lack specific skills or knowledge
- professional-client relationship or collaborative partnership
