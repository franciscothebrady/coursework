### John Rawls - A Theory of Justice (Excerpts)
Justice as Fairness - What is just is not just what is socially useful, it also has to based on the mutual equality of all people.

Original Position - An exercise to determine what all people can agree on as just. The scenario is one in which:
    - All people are rational and mutually disinterested (are not motivated by envy)
    - All people are able to participate as equals
    - All people are self-interested
Veil of Ignorance - The original position is negotiated in a setting where people do not know their own position in society. Nobody has information about their characteristics, abilities, or social and economic status.

Rawls argues that the principles that this group agrees to would be just for this group, and because of the conditions in which they agree to these principles, the principles themselves could be named principles of justice more generally.

What kind of strategy would these people utilize when negotiating?
Maximin Strategy - Rawls assumes that people are risk-averse, and that they would argue for principles that maximize the minimum position of any one person in society. This is the maximin strategy.
- Think of this as a least-loss strategy.

This leads to:
Two Principles of Justice:
1. Principle of Equal Liberty: Each person has equal rights to the most full version of basic liberties (freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, etc.) that are compatible with liberty for all others.
2. Difference Principle: Inequities can only be allowed if they are: a) expected to benefit the least well off members of society, and b) attached to positions and offices open to all members of society.
