1. J.S. Mill, On Liberty, pp. 9-13 73-82

### On Liberty
Introduction:
- "The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant." (9)
    - applies only to "capable" human beings
    - JS Mill lived in India
- People may be held accountable for "evil" done to other people through their own actions, but not necessarily through their inaction. In these cases there is often an extenuating circumstance.

Chapter IV: Of the Limits to the Authority of Society over the Individual
- "As soon as a person's conduct affects prejudicially the interests of others, society has jurisdiction over it, and the question whether the general welfare will or will not be promoted by interfering with it, becomes open to discussion." (73)
    - "general welfare" is a utilitarian concept
- Actions which only affect the individual are ok, but society is free to judge you for it.
- "Whenever, in short, there is a definite damage, or a definite risk of damage, either to an individual or to the public, the case is taken out of the province of liberty, and placed in that of morality or law." (73)

### Heath - The Machinery of Government
- 7.1: Mill's Argument
    - "The fact that a person chooses something provides strong pro tanto for believing that thing is good for him." (304)
    - A law is paternalistic if the grounds for justification contain some version of "for your own good"
- 7.1.1: The epistemic argument: what is the good life is very difficult to decide, and as such we should be permissive of people's choices, "experiment", and be tolerant, to do otherwise is paternalistic and presume what is good for you is good for everyone.
- 7.1.2: The agency argument: The state will never be able to ensure outcomes as well as the person themselves can, simply because the individual has a much higher stake to get things correct.
    - even if the state has a better idea of what is good for you, or you are doing good for yourself poorly, the state is not best suited to intervene.
- Bureaucratic paternalism: laws and regulations aimed at promoting wellbeing, even if such interventions take away individual choice. Examples given
    - innocuous example: food cart regulation in toronto
    - more controversial: pharmaceutical "gatekeeping"
