Main Reading - Scope and Limits of Moral Argument (from Causing Death and Saving Lives)

Techniques of Arguing against Moral Beliefs: 
1. Show that the moral belief depends on concepts that are blurred or incoherent
    - Example: Someone believes that homosexual acts are immoral because they are unnatural. If you ask them to define "unnatural", they will have a hard time "providing a devinition that includes homosexual acts without also including singing at the opera" (Glover 25)
2. Expose the logical inadequacies in the moral argument
    - Show that the reasons they believe to be sound are not actually sound.
    - Example: The belief that human suffering matters more than animal suffering because humans have rationality that animals do not. This belief becomes less sound when considering small children or those with mental disabilities.
3. Expose the inconsistencies in someone's principles
    - Example: If someone argues against all abortions on the principle that it is immoral to take a human life. Then you may ask whether they are a complete pacifist and against all wars. If they are not, then they must either accept that there are exceptions to the principle or that they are inconsistent.
4. Show that there are unintended consequences to the person's moral beliefs.
    - If a person supports abortion as a general principal, they may not be be as accepting of that principle being used in support of infanticide or euthanasia.

Second Reading - Letter from a Birmingham Jail

Argument: The clergymen who criticized King and the demonstrations he led objected to his decision to break the law. They conceded that there was much racial injustice in Birmingham, but they insisted that the proper recourse was the courts, and “decisions of those courts should in the meantime be peacefully obeyed.”

Most important arguments:
- They had tried the alternatives. When groups in Birmingham tried to negotiate with business owners to take down "white only" signs, they were promised changes that didn't materialize.
- " Any law that uplifts human personality is just. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust. All segregation statutes are unjust because segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality."
- "So I can urge men to obey the 1954 decision of the Supreme Court because it is morally right, and I can urge them to disobey segregation ordinances because they are morally wrong."
- "An unjust law is a code inflicted upon a minority which that minority had no part in enacting or creating because it did not have the unhampered right to vote"
    - Alabama legislature put in place the segregation laws, and had gone to a number of methods to precent African Americans from voting.

Relation to Glover:
- MLK suggests that the clergy who opposed his methods were offended by his breaking the law. He uses a form of Glover's first method of reasoning, positing that the clergy's belief (of the goodness of obeying laws) is not sufficiently nuanced because it does not take into account just vs. unjust laws. Then he defines what makes a law just or unjust. By MLK's definitions, laws upholding segregation are unjust, and therefore should be opposed or disobeyed.
- This could also be a version of the 4th method of argument: The clergy's belief that laws should be obeyed has unintended consequences, namely that unjust laws are allowed to continue unopposed.

Moral Commitments:
What moral commitments does each argument rely on?
The moral commitment is a belief that laws should be obeyed.

Are the clergymen who criticized him likely to share those commitments?
Yes, they are likely to share the commitment that laws should be obeyed.

How about the northern liberals with influence over federal policy who King hopes to reach?
Yes, they are likely to share the commitment that laws should be obeyed.

Argument: The clergymen (and others) also objected to the harm the protests brought to Birmingham—thousands jailed, at least as many injured, sometimes violent counter-protests, and general “tension” throughout the community—and they implied, correctly, that King led the protests knowing full well that these consequences were likely.

Response:
- "Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and establish such creative tension that a community that has consistently refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored."
    - Creating tension was the point, so that the community would have to confront the issues.
Re: Protests bringing about violence:
- "Isn't this like condemning Jesus because His unique God-consciousness and never-ceasing devotion to His will precipitated the evil act of crucifixion?"
    - Blaming protestors for violence is placing blame on the wrong party. The protestors are bringing attention to the violence that already exists, both on the part of the police and the community.

Relation to Glover:
This uses a similar logic to Glover's 3rd argument. MLK points out that blaming protestors for violence makes an error in the direction of causality. I think this is a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy. The clergymen are assuming that the protests caused the violence, when in fact the protests are a response to the violence that the Black population of Birmingham has been experiencing, and in fact the aims are to bring attention to the issue to force a reckoning with the problem.
