### Brock
For Miller, refugees are individuals “whose human rights cannot be protected
except by moving across a border, whether the reason is state persecution,
state incapacity, or prolonged natural disasters” (2016, 83).

According to the Geneva Convention on Refugees, states are not permitted to return refugees to their states of origin nor are they permitted to send refugees to any other state
if doing so threatens their lives or liberties. This principle is known as the "principle of non-refoulement" (principle of non-return).

Argument 1: States who have the capacity to accept refugees must do so.
"Refugees have urgent needs for safety. States in a position to meet this need have an obligation to do so." (472)

Argument 2: States that had a hand in creating refugees have a responsibility to them
"States or other parties that have acted in ways that have created, exacerbated or in
other ways contributed to the situation that refugees are now facing in their
home country have special duties to them." (472)

Argument 3: Legitimation of the state system
"If states wish to exercise power legitimately they have duties to
admit refugees when the state system has failed." (472)

### Lister
#### Definition
"To start with, we may say that a refugee is anyone whom a state has a moral duty to admit into itself, despite whatever other immigration policies the state in question may have, where this is a moral duty owed by the state, as a member of the international community, to the personseeking to enter, based on the need of the non-citizen." (648)

#### Dummit
"Dummett argues, one where ‘all conditions that deny someone the ability to live where he is in minimal conditions for a decent human life ought to be grounds for claiming refuge elsewhere’." (651)

"But, even if we apply a fairly stringent rule here this account is a very radical one, implying that hundreds of millions, perhaps billions, of the poor around the world ought to have the right to enter and remain in other countries, despite the objections of those who live in said countries." (652)

#### Dummett and Carens "Impartialist approach"

tldr: Freedom of movement should be a recognized right and refugees, if differentiated at all, should only be given priority amidst very few restraints.

As James Woodward, discussing the point in Rawlsian terms, points out,
"If freedom of movement is a fundamental right or liberty, then it falls within the
scope of Rawls’s first principle, which assigns equal liberty to all and which takes
priority over the distributive considerations aimed at improving the conditions of
the worst off which figure in the difference principle."
