### Work Requirements and Well-Being in Public Housing. Kirstin Frescoln, Mai Thi Nguyen, William M. Rohe, Michael D. Webb 

- "Currently, only eight PHAs—all participants in the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Moving to Work (MTW) demonstration program—have implemented work requirements for some or all of their work-able residents (Webb, Frescoln, and Rohe, 2014)."
- PUNISHMENT:
-- Initially, noncompliant residents are placed on a 2-month improvement plan that requires them to meet with case managers and either obtain employment or complete “work-related activities.”
-- Approved work-related activities include documented job searches, training or licensure programs, and some educational activities.
-- Continued noncompliance results in loss of one-half the household’s subsidy. In most cases, this loss means that rent would be reassessed from the minimum $75 to between $360 and $450 per month for a two- to three-bedroom unit.
-- If noncompliance continues for more than 6 months, the household loses its entire subsidy.
-- Households are evicted if they cannot pay the higher rents or if they remain noncompliant for 1 year

- Most residents believe the work requirement is fair. Among work-able respondents to a 2012 survey, 87 percent of those in the work requirement sites and 80 percent of those in the non-work-requirement sites thought so.

Recommendations:
- Other PHAs should consider a similar policy that begins with a low employment threshold (15 to 20 hours), case management for all affected households or those that are noncompliant, and provision for engagement in “work-related activities” in lieu of wage employment.
- PHAs considering implementing a work requirement should allow those subject to the policy to meet it through completion of education and job training.
- PHAs should work with local public health organizations to provide additional support for improving the health of public housing residents.
