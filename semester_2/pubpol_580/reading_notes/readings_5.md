- Smoking Ban in Public Housing

Response:
While I understand the seriousness of the public health issue, I am now more skeptical of the ban, specifically the ban on smoking inside one's apartment.
The ban is paternalistic, and while the harms associated with smoking, and in particular second-hand smoke, are well known, this ban is objectionable on the grounds that people should be able to do what they want to inside of their own spaces. Public Housing residents already face restrictions on their fourth amendment rights, allowing police and PHAs wide latitude to infringe on their privacy (https://housingmatters.urban.org/research-summary/reigning-police-surveillance-why-legal-protections-are-not-working-public-housing). The ban on smoking inside, which I understand is a public health issue, is another infringement on the rights of public housing residents. As noted in the opeds, public housing in NYC faces a number of capital and maintenance issues, some of which, if addressed, could lead to impacts at least as significant as a smoking ban.
My second reaction was to the penalties for violating the new non-smoking clauses in the leases. If any residents are caught or reported, they would be in violation of the lease, which could result in eviction. While the potential harm imposed by second-hand smoke is serious, it is an escalation of harm to place someone in danger of eviction for smoking in their own home. The NHLP brief mentions information campaigns and funding support for cessation programs, as well as moving designated smoking areas away from buildings. These initiatives are more in line with the public health aspect of the issue, focusing on education and support rather than punishment and potential homelessness.
