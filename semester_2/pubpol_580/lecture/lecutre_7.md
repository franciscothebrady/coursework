### What is a right?
- A trump (almost)
- A side constraint (Nozick)

### why protect rights?
- "Isn't it irrational to accept size constraint C rather than a view that directs minimizing the violations of C?... If nonviolation of C is so important, shouldn't that be the goal?" (Nozick)

### why protect rights?
1. Rule utilitarian rationale:
    - idea that recognizing a right that prohibits certain kinds of government action is the best way of increasing social welfare.
2. Contractarian rationale/justification of rights:
    - related to the idea of the social contract.
    - rights mark out especially important interests that people have
    - government is only legitimate insofar as it protects/guarantees these interests.
3. Dignity-based rationale:
    - certain ways of treating people violate their fundamental dignity as human beings.
    - rights mark out those ways of treating people that are especially violative of their dignity.
    - disabilitiy rights, civil rights movements, prisoners rights, are all framed by activists in terms of dignity.
4. Religious Rationales
5. Innovation-based rationale
6. External preferences rationales (Dworkin)
    - if we don't recognize rights, then the logic of utilitarian analysis will end up treating some groups unequally unintentionally.
7. Don't-be-a-hypocrite rationale

TLDR: with rights, the existence of the thing we're trying to explain is more clear than the rationale for it.

"People may not agree why we have rights, but they can agree that we need them." - Michael Ignatieff, Human Rights as Politics and Idolatry

### Positive and Negative Rights
Negative Rights:
Rights to be free from certain conditions.
- Right to free speech
- Right against unreasonable search and seizure
- Right to bear arms

These are rights for the government NOT to act against you in certain ways. Government does not have an obligation to make your speech persuasive, but cannot take away your right to speak.

"A negative right is a right that something not be done to one, that some particular imposition be withheld" - Charles Fried

Positive Rights:
Rights to a certain condition.
- Right to shelter in New York City
    - this has important policy implications and consequences, the courts have ordered NYC to secure more housing for homeless populations.
- Right to education
    - Contained in most state constitutions -- "The state must provide a system of education for all children."
- Right to an attorney in criminal trials
    - government has an obligation to provide you with an attorney even if you can't afford one.

Government has an obligation to put a roof over your head.

"A positive right is a claim to something--a share of material goods, or some particular good like the attention of a lawyer or doctor, or perhaps the claim to a result like health or enlightenment" - Charles Fried

Its possible that rights can be positive or negative:
- abortion rights: even during Roe, government has an obligation NOT to criminalize it.
- in the United States, it was not a positive right: the government does not have an obligation to pay for abortions through Medicare, or even to permit state hospital employees to perform abortions at state hospitals.

### Rights can be positive or negative, and that can change!!

Negative Rights:
- 6th amendment right to counsel in the 18th and 19th centruy (government cannot STOP you from bringing your own attorney to court)
Positive Rights:
- 6th amendment right to counsel today (government MUST provide you with an attorney)

### Difficulty with positive rights is exactly what they mean
- and what they require
- negative right proscribes certain government actions

positive rights: non-negotiable demand/obligation on what the government must or must no do.

Example: Education in Kansas. There was a successful lawsuit in Kansas that argued that the state was not providing enough funding for education, violating the state constitution right to education. The court ordered the state to provide more funding for education.
- the right to education acts as a hard constraint on government action.

### Readings: Red Flag Laws in Virginia
For the sake of discussion, we recognize that there is a right to bear arms.
What does is mean for red flag laws?
Red Flag Laws: Policies that restrict people's access to their guns.
What do state legislatures have to do to justify these laws?
- narrowly constrained
- targeted
- constraint on right is a last resort
- there is a compelling interest in the constraint

In VA, a proposed law: if an investigation determines that [a] person poses "a substantial risk of personal injury to himself or others in the near future". Within 14 days, a court hearing would be held to determine whether a more long-term order is justified. -- Moomaw, "Would Virginia's Red Flag Law Survive Constitutional Scrutiny?" (https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/would-virginias-red-flag-law-withstand-constitutional-scrutiny-other-states-similar-laws)

Objections:
- could be used to take away guns from people who the police don't like
- it's difficult to argue that VA provides mental health support for people who are at risk of harming themselves or others.

Support:
- it is narrowly tailored to just address the confiscation of guns for specific people in crisis situations
- only restricting gun rights in the narrowest possible way when there is a situation of extraordinary risk.

Concern is that if it Red Flag laws are not narrowly constrained, then the government could use it to take away guns from people who it does not like.

### Child Welfare Investigations and Rights
Parents suspected in child welfare cases are not treated in the same way in terms of their rights as people suspected of other crimes.
- Child welfare investigations are not criminal investigations

Should parents have the same rights in child welfare investigations as they do in criminal investigations?
