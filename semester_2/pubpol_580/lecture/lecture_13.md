### Neutrality

Forms of Intervention:
- coercion (bans, mandates, prohibitions)
    - currently: oregon decriminalized all drugs (still ticketable), but is now considering recriminalizing them
    - what mill has in mind when discussing whether gov't action is legitimate or not
    - on liberty was written at the time when alcohol prohibition was being debated
        - drinking might lead to some consequences which might lead to some consequences (violating the harm principle), but it makes more sense to regulate the laws against harm instead of the against the alcohol
- incentives
    - taxes, subsidies, fines, rewards
- shaping: nudges, designing choice architecture
- persuasion: education, public information campaigns

Mill sez: persuasion is always an option. If gov't disapproves of people's choices, they can always try to get them to stop.

### Neutrality
- Kwame Anthony Appiah: "The Ethics of Identity"
    - idea of neutrality is actually more basic that can justify the harm principle
    - in general: liberalism is a political philosophy, and it doesn't just mean we should disregard people's will when restricting their freedom, but as much as possible we should respect their preferences in all state actions. The state is supposed to be everybody's agent, therefore we should put restrictions on what the state can and should do.
        - this is important in places like the united states
        - religious pluralism
        - most tangible example of religious neutrality is the idea of separation of church and state
- It is difficult to figure out what, if anything that principle means in practice
- "The idea of neutrality[requires] that state acts should treat people of diverse social identities with equal respect." - Appiah, p. 91
- tldr: neutrality matters, but spelling out what this means explicitly is difficult

Examples: there are some key examples of states not being neutral, which helps to illustrate what neutrality might mean.

Counterpoints:
- Neutrality might not take into account historical injustices

### Nudges
getting into smaller groups and discussing some case studies of nudges
- come back together and discuss nudges that seem more legitimate and others that seem more problematic

What are nudges?
- trying to affect people's choices and behaviors without using force or coercion towards an outcome that the policymaker thikns is most beneficial
- part of the criterion is that the policymaker does not meaningfully restrict the options available to the person being nudged.
- Thaler and Sunstein maintain that nudges shouldn't have a significant cost, but they do not define what a significant cost is.
- Nudges have fuzzy boundaries, and it's difficult to figure out what counts as a nudge and what constitutes a barrier.

Why is Sunstein so into nudges?
- Sunstein argues that it's a way to get people to make better decisions without restricting their freedom
