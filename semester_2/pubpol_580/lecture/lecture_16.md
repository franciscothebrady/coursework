### Recap:
We've talked about:
- frameworks that protect general welfare
- frameworks that protect individual rights
- frameworks that protect liberty
Now we are talking about Justice

### Justice
Rawls' first principle of justice is that government/society should first recognize and protect the basic rights of individuals.
- it subsumes other considerations of rights, liberty and general welfare as components of justice

There are lots of competing conceptions of justice.

Readings:
- Rawls - A Theory of Justice (Excerpts)
- Nozick - The Entitlement Theory of Justice
- Anderson - What is the Point of Equality?

### Rawls
Widely acknowledged to be a central figure in the modern discussion of justice.
- not because everyone agrees with his conclusions
- but because he has provided a framework for thinking about justice that has been influential

Rawl's tries to integrate lots of different frameworks in his theory:
- Kantian, welfare economics, social contract theory, etc.

### How to engage with TOJ:
Supposed to be a theory of "The Basic Structure"
- how the basic structure of society should be organized/designed
- Institutions, laws, policies, etc.
- Is not meant to engage directly with specific policy questions
- More about principles of design of major institutions within a state

Sometimes TOJ will engage with specific policy, like the military draft
- Rawl's explicitly opposed draft deferments for college students

In theory:
1. The Original Position -->

2. Principles of Justice -- >
[REGULATES] -->
3. Basic Structure -->
[PRODUCES] -->
4. Just Outcomes

### Biography
- Rawls grew up in Baltimore, Maryland
- Served in WWII
- Formative experience of racism in Baltimore and in the South

### Weaknesses
- TOJ has little to say about race, gender and disability
- These are important to Rawls personally but does not focus on these issues in his written work
- Rawls' had a very limited understanding of disability
- TOJ mentions nuclear family as a component of the basic structure of society

Susan Moller Okin: Critical of Rawls' lack of gender analysis
- However, the original position is a powerful tool to explore and challenge traditional gender structures and roles in modern society.

### Conclusion first
- Rawls thinks that a just society is one that satisfies the two principles that he comes up with:
1. Principle of Equal Liberty -- Each person has equal rights to the most full version of basic liberties (freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, etc.) that are compatible with liberty for all others.
2. Difference Principle -- Inequities can only be allowed if they are: a) expected to benefit the least well off members of society, and b) attached to positions and offices open to all members of society (equal opportunity).

### How does Rawls come to these principles?
We should think of society as a system of cooperation that generates large benefits.
Rawls:
- Because the social structure we participate in creates so many of the benefits we enjoy, we should think hard about that societal structure.
    - it is very important!
- System is held together by a basic structure, whose design affects the distribution of benefits and burdens in society.
- Starting positions are determinative of future outcomes -- but cannot be justified by merit or desert or ability.
- We should distribute benefits and burdens in a way that is fair to all, satisfying the principles we would accept in the original position.
