### Benefit-Costs Analysis

What does utilitarianism mean in a concrete way when we talk about policy issues.
- BCAs are widely used tool in government work
- Mandated for many US federal regulatory practices
- important part of the policy analysis toolkit

### thinking through the logics of BCA
- what do you need to believe to take the conclusions of BCA seriously?
- Tani: where do you draw that line in the sand?
    - critique of BCA from a disability rights perspective
    - in what contexts does the logic of BCA not make sense.

### BCA: the basics
- BCA is a way of thinking about the costs and benefits of a policy
- Researching all of the costs associated with a particular policy and aggregating those costs
- Amassing pricing of all potential benefits for implementing a particular polciy
- There are some policy impacts that are difficult to quantify
    - environmental impacts
    - health impacts
    - social impacts

### Value of a statistical life (VSL)
- currently around $9 million
- a lot of environmental regulations might not pass the test
- Sunstein argues that advocates of BCA is not using VSL as a simple monetary value of a human life
- Rather they use VSL as a way to quantify the risk of death, as a 1 in 50,000 chance of death.

### Debate: Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) Benefit-Costs Analysis
- an extreme example of BCA

#### pros of PREA BCA:
- BCA allows analysts to compare the costs and benefits of a policy in a way that attempts to remove bias
- not perfect but it is a way to gather information
- Prisoners do not have many advocates, and the knowledge of the costs of prison violence may increase support for prisoners.
- Resources are scarce
- allows informed decisions to be made

#### cons of PREA BCA:
- attempting to quantify the monetary value of the benefits of reducing prison rape risks devaluing the lives of prisoners.
- numbers should not dictate whether we respond to our obligation to do the right thing
- BCA is not a neutral tool
- BCA is a tool that can be used to justify the status quo
