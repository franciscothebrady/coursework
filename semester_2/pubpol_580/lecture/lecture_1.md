Moral dimensions of policy evoluation and practice 

- when trynig to devcide whether some policy is a good idea or an appropriate action, one dimension is morlaity 

questions where moral values are an imporatnat part of the question arise all over the place 
- whether drugs or abortions should be illegal 
- justness of war or whether particular targets are legitimate or not 
- who qualifies as a refuggee
- how should we allocate scarce resources
- when if ever is it ok to involuntarily commit someone to a mental hospital

point of this class: give you an opportunity to sharpen your understanding of what these moral questions are and how to think about them.  
- there is a tendency in policy analysis to treat policy reform as a technical enterprise, to treat it as a question of what are the most effective means to accomplish goals. 
    - e.g. need metrics on how effective a policy is, how much it costs, etc.
    - this is the heart of the social science approach to policy analysis
    BUT 
    - this is an incomplete perspective because it leaves out a taken-for-granted list of policy goals. 
    - does not question what the goals are in and of themselves. 

We don't only want to focus on what impacts of policy are, but what those long terms impacts will be. 
Goal of the course in a nutshell is to offer a forum nad some tools for thinking about the moreal dimensions of policy and public choices. Also to broaden and deepend the policy goals.
