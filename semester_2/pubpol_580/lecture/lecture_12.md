### Harm Principle
We need to have an idea of the types of harm that qualify as harm and it's effects on society.
Policy should in general strive to intervene directly, as close as possible to the harm it's concerned about.
For Mill, this is the only principle that can justify restrictions on liberty.
For others paternalism is justified, as long as you are careful (presumption of liberty)

### When is paternalism justified?
Dennis Thompson: 3 Broad Criteria
When there is:
1. Impaired Judgement: there's reason to think the decision-maker's judgement is impaired other than the fact that we disagree with the choice itself.
- ex. addition to smoking: there is a process of decision-making related to addictrive behavior that is different from making other choices.
2. Limited restriction: the restriction on liberty should be modest and reversible.
3. Serious harm: The restriction prevents a serious and widely recognized harm.
