General Principles:
- the web of ethical belief

Start with the general principle:
- could be a statement: "it is wrong to kill"
- could be a particular goal: "we want to maximize happiness"

John Rawls - Theory of Justice
- says we can evaluate principles

Jonathan Glover - "Moral argument... often takes the form of showing someone that his beliefs have unnoticed consequences that he would find acceptable."

Example:
- general principle (start with)
- specifies
- concrete judgement

Judith Jarvis Thomson - "A Defense of Abortion"
- posits the outlandish thought experiment of the violinist to show that the general (inflexible) principle "it is wrong to kill" is not absolute. 
    - if you accept the general principle (taking an innocent life is wrong), then you must accept the concrete judgement (abortion is wrong)
    - because most people will not accept the judgement that killing the violinist is wrong, then they are forced to admit that the general principle is not absolute.

- more useful and practical to stick closer to real world cases, rather than outlandish thought experiments of philosophers.

Jonathan Glover - "Causing Death and Saving Lives"
- in laws of war it is generally accepted that it's wrong to aim to attack/kill civilians
- the problem is that legitimate military targets almost always put civilians at risk
    - when is it acceptable to risk civilian lives?
Glover cites up the unrevised double effect principle:
if:
- risk to civilian life is unintentional
- and proportionate to the military advantage gained
then the action putting civilian life in danger is morally acceptable.
else it is wrong.

- Frank Richards - WWI soldier who was investigating cellars in occupied France
    - shouted first to see if civilians were present before throwing grenades into cellars.
    - The unrevised principle of double effect says that Richard's did not have to shout first.
    - Richard's felt they had a moral obligation to protect civilian lives, even if it meant risking their own lives.
        - Walzer says that Richards was acting morally,
        - this shows that the traditional double effect principle is too permissive
        - thinks we should replace the principle of proportionality with a principle of due care. soldiers have a positive duty to minimize risk to civilians, even if it comes at some risk to themselves.

Walzer's revised double effect principle:
- attack that imposes risks on civilians is justifiable only
if:
    - risks are unintentional
    - and it takes due care to minimize risks to civilians

Glover: "There's nothing like a visit to prison to change one's ideas about acceptable punishments."

tldr: when you're thinking about moral arguments, you can think more broadly than just philosophical analysis. It's possible to include personal history and experience, because responses to those stories may cause some people to modify their beliefs or positions.

## casuistry
comparing cases to see if they are similar or different
- to go from general principles to concrete judgements
- if x is wrong, then y, which is similar, could also be wrong

## walzer's revised principle
- attack that imposes risks on civilians is justifiable only if:
1. risks are unintentional
2. and it takes due care to minimize risks to civilians

examples:
- bombing runs in occupied france -- soldiers flew lower (at risk to themselves being shot down) to minimize risk to civilians and increase accuracy of bombing runs.

# general principle:
- take "due care" to minimize civilian risk
# which specifies:
- risks we willingly pose to "our" citizens
# potentially analogous
- risks we willingly pose to "their" citizens

## ethical arguments 
- look at the implications for principle X, and see if they are acceptable to the person who holds principle X
