Memo:
- don't need to follow strict memo format
- just need engage with the substance of the ideas as we've covered them in class
- acknowledge sources, don't need to do any outside research

### Refugee Status

Refugee policy as part of general immigration policy
underlying assumption is that nation's have a lot of discretion on how to deal with their own immigration policy.
- if a country has social goals to limit immigration in certain ways, they are allowed to do that
- if they have economic goals that involve limiting immigration, they can do so.

Refugees are different:
- category of refugees are people who have a claim to certain rights
- status of refugee is an exception to that general policy that country's can set their own immigration policy.

International Human Rights movements:
- have tried to set certain limits to actions that states can take
- humans have specific rights that shouldn't be violated
- sometimes thre are consequences when states violate human rights

Some countries havbe incorporated human right's provisions into domestic law
- see: Darwish asylum case (person claimed asylum based on well founded fear of persecution in afghanistan)

Informal Pressure:
- put on states who routinely violate human rights provisions
- can be harder to get loans or work in international community.

### Refugees
Core example of the international human rights framework
What rights do refugees have?
Who qualifies for these rights?

#### Asylum/Refugee Distinction?
Asylum: temporary solution
Refugee: longer-term solution
Different rights that people who fit the definition of refugee have?

#### Core Rights of Refugees
1. Non-rafoulement: The right of refugees who arrive to not be sent back into danger.
2. Refuge: Immediate protection for the duration of the danger term.
    - UNHCR Camps
    - Long-run durable solution
    - Resettlement
    - Voluntary repatriation after danger is dealt with

#### Positive/Negative Rights
1. Non-return:
    - can be a negative right because it is restricting what the government can do to someone
2. Refuge/Resettlment/Durable Solutions/Repatriation:
    - positive rights: States must provide people with food, shelter, decent living conditions for the duration of their refugee stay. Potentially states must do something to arrange for repatriation or negotiation of return.

Negative rights aren't stronger but they are less complex than positive rights.

### Discussion:

#### Against expanding the definition:
##### Speaker One
- UNHCR Definition:
    - Well founded fear of state persecution
    - outside nation of their nationality
- Arguments:
    - serves a compelling interest
    - tailored
- Expanding definition poses dangers:
    - strains resources
    - resistance to integration
    - backlash
    - marginalize
- Alternatives:
    - expanded aid

##### Speaker Two
- Economies cannot absorb increase
- Voluntary migrants are different
- Refugees are not voluntary
- People have the right to a nationality
    - UNHCR says so
    - If a state persecutes a person, they don't have the protection of a state, and thus need to find a new state.
    - No amount of aid will protect that person in their country.

#### For Expanding Definition
- Current UNHCR does not consider natural disasters, non-state actors
- Focuses on immediate danger and need for safety
- More inclusive definition would include more affected.
- Current strict definition is outdated.
- LGBT+ who may struggle to prove fear of persecution
- Definition has been amended before

### TLDR
- why should we care more about people who's needs stem from some source of state persecution
