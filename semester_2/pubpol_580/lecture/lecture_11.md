Liberty!
- definitions
- value of liberty
- exceptions:
    - justified paternalism
    - constraints

### What are we talking about when we talk about liberty?
There is some overlap when we talk about liberty and rights
- share a common thread about the limits of government authority over individuals actions
- even when individuals approve of the government's actions

### What is liberty?
Distinct from the idea of rights in that it is broader
- one way to think about rights is to say they protect things that are so fundamentally important that the government has to protect those things before doing anything else.
- liberty is related to the concept that this thing is not anyone else's business.
- usually an objection to the government's authority to regulate or control something that is individual or private.
ex. nyc mayor bloomberg's attempt to ban large sodas, trans fats, and smoking in public places.

Two concerns may be related:
- classic policy example of liberty and paternalism: state laws that require motorcyclists to wear helmets.
- group called ABATE that challenges these laws.

Liberties are whatever's left:
- after we subtract what society is interested in
- and protect rights that are important enough to enumerate

### On Liberty
- JS Mill - "As soon as any part of a person's conduct affects prejudicially the interests of others, society has jurisdiction over it, and the question whether the general welfare will or will not be promoted by interfering with it, becomes open to discussion."
- contrast with act utilitarianism: if there is evidence that a law will promote the general welfare, then it makes sense to enact it.

Examples:
- policy to tax cigarettes: $5 million cost
- policy on second hand smoke: $6 million cost
- utilitarianism would say that the case for regulation is stronger in the second case. The benefits from the regulation are greater than the costs. A straight utilitarian analysis would not make a distinction between the risks you choose for yourself and the risks you impose on others.

Contrast between:
- the risks you choose to run for yourself
- the risks you impose on other people

"The public is willing to accept "voluntary" risks roughyl 1,000 times greater than "involuntary" risks." - Chauncey Starr

### Politics of Liberty
- in USA in 2024, the idea that the government should leave people alone is most closely associated with the libertarian party and the political right.
- commitment to liberty has historically been associated with republicans.
    - arguments against big government
- concern for personal liberty shouldn't be only associated with libertarian, small gov't, uniquely american mantas
- this is relevant for other ideological movements as well
- libertarian arguments for privacy is a value that's also important for the rights of sexual minorities, abortion rights, and other issues.

### JS Mill
- Makes a strong case for personal freedom
- thought personal freedom was in danger in Britain in the 19th century, from people who want society to act more "virtuously"
- Mill thought that intense interest into personal virtue was popular in his time.
- Current debates around alcohol prohibition being discussed in the UK and US.
- 1853: Michigan enacted prohibition laws
- argument was a slippery slope argument
- Mill thought alcohol prohibition was an unjustified infringement on personal freedom.

> "The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant." - On Liberty, p.9

### Whats wrong with paternalism?
1. epistemic argument: "With respect to his own feelings and circumstances the most ordinary man or woman has means of knowledge immeasurably surpassing those that can be possessed by any one else."
    - you know your situation best, and will make choices accordingly.
    - has been used repeatedly as an objection against paternalistic legislation.
2. Autonomy Argument: paternalism and restrictions on freedom, even when they're benevolent, undermine independence and human dignity.
3. The agency argument: policymakers who are acting for paternalistic reasons have to authorize an agent to enact their paternalizing policies. This agent will never have the same stake in the outcome as the person who is being acted upon.
4. The surveillance argument: efforts to enforce paternalistic laws require a level of surveillance that is incompatible with a free society. (e.g. drug testing, etc.)

### Harm Principle
- "The only purpose for which **power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.** His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant." - On Liberty, p.9
- The difficult part is defining what constitutes private action.
- The harm principle is not as effective of a principle because of arguments by people who argue about what constitutes social harm.

### Types of Harm (Exceptions to the Harm Principle)
These are types of harm that can be subject to regulation.
1. Consensual harm: if it also affects, people, only with their free, voluntary, and undeceived consent.
2. Indirect Harms (remote harms): The harms that are caused indirectly, or remotely, by the actions of others.
Conclusion: Policy should try to intervene directly, as close as possible to the harm that it is concerned about.
