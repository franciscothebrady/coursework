### What Democracy Requires

As public officials we are supposedly doing the public's work, and that often gives us a reason to set aside our own moral thinking and focus on what your agency is instructing you to do.
This is important **most of the time**. There is sometimes a tension with what you think is the right thing to do, and what your agency is instructing you to do.

For ex. Herbert Wechsler was faced with defending the policy of internment during WWII, even though he did not agree with it.

### Applbaum (The Remain's of the Role)

When is official disobedience justified?
Applbaum describes his topic this way: obedience to political authority in the face of substantice disagreement about public policy.

Responding to an argument put forward by Michael Quinlan.
- Both Quinlan and Applbaum appeal to a division of ethical responsibility between personal and professional roles.
- Wechsler: "It was not my responsibility to order or not to order the Japanese evacuation... It was the responsibility of the President of the United States, who had been elected by the people of the United States."

Applbaum: "The person of the civil servant and so the political commitments and the substantive judgements of that person are to be completely submerged when the role demands deference to the commitments and judgements of others."
- Morally demanding because you have to subsume your own moral thinking to the role you are playing.

- Applbaum: "Some socially useful roles require the development of vices and the supression of virtues, so that good professionals become bad people"

Why does Applbaum argue this:
- There is some value in making a separation of function between personal and professional roles.
- What exactly is the benefit of this type of separation?
- Quinlan and Wechsler are both making a sort of rule utilitarian argument and Applbaum is asking what the benefit of the rule is.

### Applbaum's Argument
- "A role thtat generally aims at important social goods and political values, as does the British civil service, generally should be oberyed."
- But not always!

### Alternative
1. Civil Servant's shouldn't juts defer to their bosses, sometimes it's useful to ask to what ends
2. Sometimes disgreements can be about what those shared goals actually are
3. "Conflicts between a public officials political morality and the demands of the professional role will not be rare"
4. More complicated cases:
    - Applbaum thinks that liberal government should strive for neutrality

Example: Kim Davis (Kentucky County Clerk)
- claimed that she could not issue marriage licenses in good conscience for same-sex marriages
- Applbaum would say that this justification is illegitimate (The liberal preclusion), because she was appealing to personal religious values to dictate her professional role.
    - The right course of action would have been for her to resign instead.
    - Disobedience in this case is inappropriate.

### Political Morality
if you think teh system as a whole is oriented towards unjust ends, then you have a dispute of political morality, where disobedience may be justified.
- it is arrogant to impose your conception of political morality on everyone else
- civil servants are not elected officials

### Exception
- "There is, then, atr least one circumstance under whihc the appeal to the legitimate authority of the elected politician is not sufficient to demand of a public servant obediance to the role, and that is **when the elected politician acts in ways that undermine the institutions of democratic legitimacy, and so acts without legitimate authority**."

### Conclusion
Need to think hard about the nature of the disagreement that we have.
- is it an issue of justice or a personal policy disagreement?
- we should be asking about the nature of the disagreement and the nature of the role that we are playing.
- if it's a personal policy disagreement, you may not be the sole decider of what is a just outcome.
- if the disagreement is about the nature of the role, then you may have a legitimate reason to disobey.
- Principled disobedience is easier to justify if you can point to good reasons to second guess public priorities.

#### Requirements for a democracy
    1. Regular Elections: Enough that office-holders understand they have to answer to public opinion.
    2. Checks and Balances aka divided authority
    3. Minority-protecting mechanisms: to detatch power from the interests of any particular group within the community.
    4. Full Inclusion: alignment of natural and actual polities.
