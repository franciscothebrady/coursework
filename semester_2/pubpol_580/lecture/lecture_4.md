Discussion on Utilitarianism

### last time
main claim: when we are making a choice about what to do, we should choose the option that has the best consequences for overall welfare.

- quality adjusted life year (QALY)
- used as a metric to address health impacts of policy options
- one way of operationalizing utilitarianism (maximizing QALYs)
- cost-benefit analysis aims to evaluate overall impacts on welfare
    - we will cover this later on

### is this good advice?
- is utilitarian framing a good idea?

### problems for utilitarianism
- epistemic critique: we don't know enough about the consequences to make a good judgements/be good utilitarians
    - given the uncertainty about the future, does utilitarianism give us good tools to deal with those.
    - thacher, the aspirations of scientific policing (2019)
- distributional concerns: we care about the distribution of welfare not just its level
    - marginal utility of money/benefits/etc
- the problem of illegitimate preferences: we cannot forget about the content of peoples preferences.
    - there has to be a way to deal with bad preferences, such as racists, etc.
    - utilitarians contend that all preferences should we weighted equally, but some preferences are nuisances or even dangerous.
- rights: some actions are just off limits, regardless of their overall consequences.
- personal integrity: what are the limits on your responsibility to make the world go as well as it can possibly go?
- commensurability: can we compare diverse types of value?
    - it's hard to measure wellbeing, and people have different understandings of what that entails.
