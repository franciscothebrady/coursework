### Last time:
using general principles to make decisions for specific cases
e.g. smoking ban in public housing, is that ban consistent with our general views of the limits of government power on individual actions. 

we will become familiar with some general principles of moral reasoning and how to apply them to specific cases

five values: welfare (utility), rights, liberty, justice, and democracy
- using them as guideposts to think about hard policy questions
- specific domains in which to apply these values is important

### Utilitarianism
Bentham: thought overriding aim of public policy was to maximize happiness and minimize pain.
- gov't should only do things that maximize overall pleasure and minimize pain.
- rights, democracy, etc are only means and not ends, the real goal is to maximize happiness and minimize pain

### structure of different moral theories
- hinman: utilitarianism is an example of what philosophers call consequentialist moral theory (as opposed to deontological moral theory)
- consequentialists believe that the consequences of an action are the only relevant considerations in determining whether that action is right or wrong
- deontological theorists give more weight to the motives of an action. believe we have a duty to behave in certain ways.
- moral theories that place a lot of importance on individual rights are more deontological in nature.

### deontology
- many of the most important moral theories are deontological
- ten commandments -- are almost all framed in terms of deontological duties
- morality in these kinds of formulations are at least partly about what we should do as opposed to what we want to achieve (consequences)
- consequentialist theories reject all of this. they say that the only thing that matters is the consequences of our actions. whether or not the person intended those consequences.

"what matters isn't who does the good, only that the good is done" - amia srinivasan, stop the robot apocalypse.

### utilitarianism
- utilitarianism is the most important consequentialist moral theory
- best policy is the one that maximizes the overall level of happiness and minimizes the overall level of pain in a society
- main point of utilitarianism is to reject the idea that there are any moral rights that are absolute

### 18th-19th century context
- jeremy bentham (1748 - 1832): "father of utilitarianism"
- more important were the reform efforts that he was involved in
    - prison reform
    - political reform
- part of the philosophical radicals (group of thinkers who were interested in reforming the british political system)
- wanted to develop a rigorous way to criticize and press for change in the british political system
- wanted to eliminate moralistic laws
- "everybody to count for one, and no one for more than one" (attributed to bentham by john stuart mill)
- this was radical for the time, only elite property-holders had a vote
- JS mill used this principle to argue for rights for women in "The Subjection of Women" (1869)

### british east india company
- James Mill (father of JS mill) was a high-ranking official in the british east india company
- James Mill never learned any indian languages
- Had very little respect for tradition and history

### Peter Singer
- contemporary utilitarian philosopher
- writes for a more popular audience
- "Writings on an Ethical Life" (2000)
    - four claims about utilitarianism
    - 1. pain is bad, no matter whose pain it might be
    - 2. humans are not the only beings capable of suffering
    - 3. when we consider how serious it is to take a life, we should consider the characteristics of that which is being killed.
    - 4. we are responsible not only for what we do, but also for what we could have prevented
- abstraction from the question of whether you are actively doing something versus passively allowing something to happen.
- similarly abstracts from the intention or motive behind the level of pain.
- what matters most is the amount of pain in the world, not the amount of pain that you yourself inflict.

### utilitarianism as an egalitarian theory
- everybody's utility counts equally
- no matter race, sex, or species (animals count too)
- singer: humans are not the only beings capable of suffering
- utilitarianism is seemingly all-encompassing. it presents itself as a theory that can be applied to all situations. situations that are unclear can be addressed by more data and more analysis.

### limits of utilitarianism
- epistemic critique: we don't know enough to apply utilitarianism in practice.
    - the more uncertain the figures the less useful the calculations, and the more we end up relying on commonsense understanding of what's worth doing.
- distributional critique: we care about the distribution of welfare and not just it's overall level.
- the problem of illegitimate preferences: should all preferences really count?
    - "if all feelings are of equal value... then morally good and justifiable feelings will have no greater weight than morally evil and unjustifiable feelings" - hinman, p. 144
    - e.g. racist preferences
