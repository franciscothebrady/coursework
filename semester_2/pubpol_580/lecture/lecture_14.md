### nudge wrap up
- sunstein is naive about the fact that nudges can avoid partisan issues
- e.g. "cooling off period" requirements for abortions

policy issues where there is a lot of intense debate are bad candidates for nudges.

when is nudging appropriate?
- doesn't make sense when there is intense social disagreement/polarizatoin about the issue.

Neutrality:
- defined by appiah as "not taking sides"
- tldr: when issues are contentions and polarised, if people have instense moral disagreement about the issue, then a "liberal" state should not take sides.

### nurse home visitation

- nurse home visitation is a program that sends nurses to visit new mothers in their homes.
- lots of countried around the world have programs like this.

- interesting example of a government policy trying to shape people's personal lives

public-private distinction
- for mills: line where gov't coercion is legitimate or illegitimate

ethical issues:
- home visitors are actively trying to influence the behavior of the people they are visiting
- involves personal and sometimes intimate decisions about how to raise children
- also happens firmly within the private sphere

Focault:
- in complex interdependent societies, they cannot tolerate deviance well
- increasingly government encourages all people to be productive, economically and socially
- cultural and conceptual pressures to conform to certain norms
