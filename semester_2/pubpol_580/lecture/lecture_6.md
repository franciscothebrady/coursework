### Last time
PREA (Prison Rape Elimination Act)
- One defense is that this type of cost-benefit analysis helps to bring to light groups that are affected by the policy who are often marginalized in the normal political process that typically shapes policy.
- Sunstein: "How much are people being helped? How much are people being hurt?... Cost benefit analysis is the best available method for assessing the effects of regulation on welfare."
- DOJ analysis raises the possibility that WTP estimates to prevent sexual assault and rape might be less than the WTP to prevent these types of issues in prisons particularly.
    - DOJ rejects this argument becuase the government has a responsibility to protect people in it's care.
    - Congress's purpose in enacting PREA was to counteract the cultural tendency to take prison rape for granted; this tendency is in turn largely driven by the diminished value some in society may place on the tribulations of prisoners.

tldr: PREA report is example of analysts trying to look at a policy from a utilitarian perspective.
- in this context, a more appropriate way to evaluate is from a more rights-based framework

### Rights
What are rights?
Why are they important?
What are there limits?

#### What are rights?
- Not an easy answer to this question
- People disagree about the answer to this
- One common view is that "Rights are trumps" (Dworkin)
    - a trump suit is the suit that always beats other cards regardless of their value
    - any "right" as a trump beats even the strongest utilitarian argument
- scalia: "the enshriment of constitutional rights necessarily takes certain policy choices off the table" (DC v. Heller)

Dworkin:
- if someone has a right... this means that it is wrong for officials to act in violation of that right.
- political rights are trumps over otherwise adequate justifications for political action
- rights as trumps is also a bulwark against majoritarian democracy (tyranny of the majority)
- reading was a response to utilitarians

Example: Stop-and-frisk
- Stop and frisk is a crime control tactic
- made famous by NYPD around 2000s
- Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) sued NYPD in 2008
- CCR argued that stop and frisk violated their rights in two ways:
    - 14th amendment: equal protection clause because police were stopping people based on race
    - 4th amendment: unreasonable search and seizure because police didn't have reasonable suspicion to stop people
- Challenge CCR used was not:
    - this is not an effective program
    - the benefits exceed the costs
    - (these are utilitarian arguments)
- Challenge CCR used was:
    - Does what NYPD was doing violate people's rights?
    - (this is a rights-based argument)
- Lots of evidence put forward in the case describing the nature of the policy under scrutiny
    - consequntialists are less concerned with the nature of the policy, only the consequences
    - rights-based arguments paint a detailed picture of what the officers were doing and why they were doing it -- more concerned with motives and whether or not they could be characterized as violating rights

QTNAs to make a rights-based argument:
### Does this government action violate rights?
1. What is the nature of the action?
    - in what circumstances do officers make stops?
    - what reasons do they have for making them?
    - do they consider race?
2. What is the content of that right?
    - in what circumstances is it legitimate for the police to stop someone?
    - what reasons for suspecting someone in involved in a crime "reasonable"?
        - the court had to supply a body of law that helps define these questions.

### what is a right?
First order answer is rights are trumps.
- but we have to be careful about the scope of rights in question

Complicating consideration is that there are downsides to being stringent and inflexible about rights...
Jamal Green argues that rights are trumps (almost), and that it can be destructive to be too stringent about rights.

Sometimes when a right is being violated, a court will apply "strict scrutiny" to any rationale for infringing it.
- this means the government has to show that the policy:
    - serves a compelling interest, and
    - is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.
- this is a very high bar to clear

Example: Law in Massachusetts that banned protesting within 35 feet of an abortion clinic.
- court had to examine whether the law:
    - plausibly served a compelling interest
    - was narrowly tailored to achieve that interest
- court concluded that the law:
    - DID serve a compelling interest
    - BUT was not narrowly tailored because it was not the least restrictive means of achieving the state's interest.
    - Restricted free speech rights too much
- court struck down the law

### Are there alternatives?
Jamal Green's claim is that we should devote less time to pursuing arcane legalisms and more time thinking about alternatives that can achieve the same ends at less cost to individual freedom and equality.

Legal framework for thinking about rights is useful as a framework for thinking about rights.
- not restricted to legal contexts
- Green's claim is that we've been too willing to leave rights-thinking to the courts

### Nozick
- Rights violations as something to be minimized in society, vs
- Rights violations as a side constraint on the actions to be done

Side constraint view forbids you to violate these moral constraints in the pursuit of your goals.
- deontological thinking: you have a duty not to violate these constraints
- consequentialist thinking: you should not violate these constraints because doing so would be bad for society

Negative rights are general constraints on what governments can do to you

Example: Family Separation Policy of Trump Administration
- Argument: In the long run it helps save more children than it harms because it deters people from coming to the US.
Even if you accept the factual premise fo the arguments, from a human rights perspective it's still a violation of rights.
- can't treat children as a means to the end of deterring other children from being harmed through a journey to the US.
- you have to treat children's rights as a side constraint on the actions you take to achieve your goals.
- Admin is doing what Nozick is warning against: treating rights as something to be minimized rather than a side constraint on the actions you take.
