Memo 3
I. Introduction
Working in public service often comes with many rules and regulations that detail the correct approach to various processes, however there can be some cases which a public employee may face when they are confronted with a situation that is not properly accounted for by the rules. In these cases, sometimes an employee must use their own discretion to come to the right course of action. In some cases, they may be confronted with unethical, and in some extreme cases, illegal behavior. In these situations, an employee needs to decide along several factors what their obligation is to the public, to their employer, and to themselves. This memo will explore the ethical dilemmas faced by Peter Buxtun, a public health service employee who exposed the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, and analyze the implications of his actions for public policy and ethics.
Peter Buxtun was a public health service employee who brought the Tuskegee Syphilis Study to public attention. The Tuskegee Study was a research project conducted by the U.S. Public Health Service from 1932 to 1972, in which African American males were denied treatment for syphilis to study the natural progression of the disease. Even though at the time of the experiment no laws were being broken, the Tuskegee Syphilis Study was a clear violation of ethical principles. The study was conducted without informed consent, and the participants were deceived about the nature of the research. The revelation of the study led to significant changes in research ethics and public health policy in the United States.
II. Part 1: Description of Peter Buxtun's Experiences and the Tuskegee Syphilis Study
The Tuskegee Syphilis Study began in 1932, and was aimed at understanding the effects of untreated syphilis. At the time, there was no real treatment for the disease except for mercury and arsenic-based compounds, which were toxic and ineffective. The study was conducted in Macon County, Alabama, and involved 600 African American males, 399 of whom had syphilis, while 201 were used as controls. The participants were told they would receive free medical care, hot meals, and burial insurance, and that they were being treated for "bad blood," a term used locally to describe various illnesses. The study was supposed to last six months, but it continued for 40 years.
Peter Buxtun was a venereal disease investigator at the U.S. Public Health Service in San Francisco in the 1960s. In 1966, he overheard a discussion between two other colleagues about a man in Alabama suffering from syphilis who was taken by his family to a doctor. The doctor treated the patient, and was then contacted and reprimanded by the investigators in the Tuskegee study. Buxtun requested and was sent more information about the study, and approached his superiors with his concerns.
Penicillin was discovered as a promising treatment for syphilis in the 1940s, even prompting another study to end early because of the early success of the treatment. However, the Tuskegee study continued to run for another 30 years without providing the participants access to this cure.
Buxtun raised his concerns with his superiors at the Public Health Service, but his complaints were dismissed. He then contacted the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the Associated Press to expose the study. His whistleblowing efforts led to the termination of the study in 1972 and the establishment of new regulations for human research.
When Buxtun initially raised concerns about the Tuskegee Study, he faced resistance from his superiors and colleagues, who were reluctant to raise the issue. Many feared professional repercussions or damage to their careers. Buxtun wrote a letter to the CDC outlining the ethical violations of the study, but received no response. After a second letter, he was summoned to Atlanta, where he was upbraided by the study investigators and told to drop the matter. The investigators commissioned a blue-ribbon panel to review the study, but the panel concluded that the study should continue.
III. Part 2: Analysis of the Ethical Issues
When the Tuskegee Study began, there were no ethical standards for human research, but as early as 1909 experts knew that informed consent of the study population was a best practice for medical research. After the full revelation of the extent of human trials conducted by Nazi doctors during World War II, the Nuremberg Code was established in 1947, which outlined the principles of informed consent and voluntary participation in medical research. The Tuskegee Study violated these principles, and Buxtun's letter to the CDC made this connection explicit. The continuation of the study after a known treatment for syphilis was discovered made the study unnecessary. The fact that all of the participants were poor Black sharecroppers recasts the decision in a racial light. From their actions, the researchers showed that they did not value the lives of the participants, given one of the conditions of participation was consenting to an autopsy after death.
Peter Buxtun's decision to go to the press with the information about the Tuskegee Study is an example of making an ethical decision in the face of institutional pressure. Buxtun's superiors warned against him raising his concerns. Other employees at the Public Health Service were aware of the study, but either not bothered or were able to compartmentalize their knowledge of the study from their ethical selves away from work. No parts of the study were illegal, and the study was not a secret, having already published several "updates" on the progress of the test subjects. This type of logic is explored in Arthur Applbaum's "Ethics for Adversaries". Applbaum describes role morality, which he defines as the moral standards that are specific to a particular role or job. In the case of the Tuskegee Study, the researchers were under the obligation to conduct the study as it was designed, and to not question the ethics of the study. Buxtun, however, was not able to separate his personal ethics from his role morality, and felt compelled to act on his concerns.
For the principal investigators of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, the experiment was in line with their objectives to advance science. When the study was initiated in 1932, there was no successful treatment for syphilis. Once a treatment was discovered, the continuation of the study was justified on the grounds that valuable information would come from the study of the development of the disease. There can be no doubt that racist attitudes towards the study population played a part in how the study recruited volunteers, as well as the decision to continue the study long past the time when an effective treatment was available for the disease. The investigators were able to adopt different moral positions than what they would normally adhere to, as they were able to justify their actions based on the goals of the study.
When Buxtun made the decision to hand over the information on the Tuskegee study to a reporter for the Associated Press, he was acting as a whistleblower. Since he was no longer working for the Public Health Service, he was not in any danger of retaliation from his employer. However, even after a career change, he felt compelled to speak up about the study, and it resulted in front page reporting in the New York Times, a congressional investigation, and eventually the establishment of a new set of regulations for human research compiled in the Belmont Report. This report outlines the ethical principles and guidelines for human research based on the core tenets of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice - all of which the Tuskegee Study violated.
Buxtun's actions were effective in bringing the Tuskegee Study to public attention and ultimately leading to its termination. However, one could argue that he could have taken action sooner than waiting until after multiple attempts to raise his concerns were rebuffed by superiors. His actions were ultimately successful in exposing the unethical practices of the study and leading to changes in research ethics.
IV. Conclusion
Peter Buxtun's ethical decisions in blowing the whistle on the Tuskegee Syphilis Study were a pivotal moment in upholding ethical integrity in the public service sector. As a public health worker, Buxtun recognized the grave ethical violations of denying treatment to the study participants and persisted in his efforts to bring this unethical study to light despite institutional pressures to remain silent.
The Tuskegee case exposed the moral shortcomings that can arise when unethical practices become institutionally accepted and normalized. It highlighted the need for greater ethical oversight and accountability measures in publicly-funded research studies and medical trials. The revelations sparked widespread public outrage that ultimately led to the establishment of stricter research protocols and ethics guidelines encapsulated in the Belmont Report.
While the ethical lapses of the Tuskegee study are an undeniable stain on the legacy of public health research, Buxtun's whistleblowing paved the way for more robust safeguards and a heightened commitment to ethical integrity. His courageous stand underscores how the moral conviction of a single individual can catalyze transformative change.
As such, the Tuskegee case serves as a powerful reminder of the necessity for ethical vigilance, especially in fields like public health and medical research where human lives and wellbeing are at stake. Public servants must be willing to uphold moral and ethical principles even in the face of institutional inertia or resistance. A strong personal ethical code, like that demonstrated by Peter Buxtun, is essential to prevent unethical practices from taking root and violating the fundamental rights and dignity of people.
The hard-learned lessons from the Tuskegee saga have reverberated through modern research practices and protocols. Today, institutional review boards, informed consent requirements, and strict ethical guidelines govern any studies involving human participants. However, ethical lapses can still occur which is why it remains critical for researchers, medical professionals, and public health officials to maintain the highest standards of moral integrity.
Ultimately, the legacy of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study and Peter Buxtun's whistleblowing underscores that genuine progress in public health and scientific inquiry must be rooted in an unwavering commitment to ethics. Only by upholding such ethical principles can the public's trust be maintained in the research and public health institutions that work to promote the wellbeing of all. Buxtun's moral courage serves as an inspiring example of the transformative power of upholding ethical convictions in public service.
