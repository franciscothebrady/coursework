Work Requirements for Housing Support Fails the Test of Progress
Ruth Archer's new presidential administration has recently proposed expanding public housing agencies' authority to impose work requirements on working-age, nondisabled people receiving federal housing assistance. 139 of the nation's approximately 3,000 public housing authorities have already implemented some form of work requirements. Expanding the authority to impose work requirements is a bad idea, plain and simple. The last time the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) expanded the number of participating agencies, they did so in the face of evidence that was not only inconclusive but also suggested that work requirements could have negative effects on the very people they were intended to help. More importantly, the drive to impose work requirements on public housing residents is based on inconsistent and discriminatory principles that undermine the fundamental human right to housing for all Americans.
In the same year that Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Housing Act of 1937, he said: "The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.” In the almost 85 years since, public housing has been a cornerstone of the nation's response to housing crises and social welfare needs. Public housing exists to ensure that the basic human need for shelter is met. It is a positive right grounded in human dignity, not a contingent benefit that can be stripped based on subjective "deservingness" tests like work status.
Supporters of work requirements for public housing residents argue that they're necessary to promote self-sufficiency and that it's important for residents to participate in the economy. Florida Sen. Rick Scott argues: "We need as many Americans as possible to have skin in the game, participate in our great system, pay taxes, and not sit at home waiting for a government check."
It's worth pausing to think through the first part of this argument. Sen. Scott's statement implies that equal participation in our society is made possible only through paid labor. That individual's worth and stake in their community is measured only by their contributions to the economy. People have to "earn" their spot to participate in our great system, and those who fall on hard times or are unable to work, who need assistance with a basic human need–a place to live–have not "earned" it. Where else do we apply those rules?
Imagine a world where we applied the same logic to other public benefits. Imagine being denied your child's place in public school simply because you aren't working. Or being placed on probation and only allowed to borrow one book from the library if you don't work at least 20 hours that month. The underlying logic fails to pass muster when we consider other public programs and goods citizens of all incomes can enjoy. The argument to do so is simple: Our government decided long ago that providing a basic education to all children, regardless of income, is a public good that benefits society as a whole. The same is true for public libraries, parks, and public transportation. Why should housing be any different?
Scott then goes on to imply that those who are not in the labor force are "sitting at home waiting for a government check." This is simply not true. Over two-thirds of non-exempt adults receiving housing assistance are already working, but again, this part of the statement demands more scrutiny. Scott's characterization reveals a critical oversight in many conservative arguments for work requirements: the narrow definition of "work" that is used to justify them. According to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, 67% of households receiving federal rental assistance have children or are caring for elderly or disabled family members. These individuals are working, but their labor is not compensated by a paycheck. If supporters of work requirements want to ensure that all Americans are contributing to society, they should recognize that the work of caring for family members is just as valuable as paid labor.
In John Rawls' "A Theory of Justice," he describes a just social order as one organized along two principles: first, each person has access to equal rights and liberties, and second, society must be arranged so that its least advantaged members are provided for. This calls to mind FDR's test of progress above. When people need the most support, such as stable housing, we have agreed as a society that it is in our collective interest to help them. This is why public housing exists. It is a recognition that housing is a fundamental human need and that society has a responsibility to ensure everyone has access to it. The imposition of work requirements, however well-intentioned, undermines this principle.
The drive to impose work requirements on public housing residents is based on inconsistent and discriminatory principles that undermine the fundamental human right to housing for all Americans. Public housing is a cornerstone of the nation's response to housing crises and social welfare needs. It exists to ensure that the basic human need for shelter is met. Support for work requirements is based on discriminatory and unfounded ideas about the value of labor and the worth of individuals who are not in the labor force. It is inconsistent with our principles and how access to any other public good is determined. We have much more work to do to ensure that every American has access to safe, affordable housing, and housing assistance is a critical part of that effort. Public housing authorities around the country should be focused on expanding access to housing, not imposing arbitrary and discriminatory work requirements on residents.
