### Today
- does "racial fractionalization" explain why less redistribution in the U.S.?
    - smaller welfare state / less social spending
    - larger hidden / often regressive welfare state 
    - less public goods with redistributive consequences

- given immigration induced ethnic and religious diversity, is the european welfare state in trouble?

### Alesina and Glaeser (2004)

Racial fractionalization
- trying to measure the probability that two randomly selected individuals are from different racial groups
- implicitly measuring homogeneity
- across all countries, there is a general negative relationship between racial fractionalization and redistribution. As countries become more racially diverse, they tend to have less redistribution.

Black Population
- states with higher % of black population have lower AFDC benefits (negative relationship)
- highest: California
- lowest: Mississippi

Research Question? Causal Chain
- White majority and Black minority post-slavery, Black groups are in a worse economic position from the beginning.
    - when policy of redistribution is being implemented, arguing for a "smaller" welfare state by creating a situation where Black workers are less deserving of benefits. Political actors become incentivized to exploit racial animus to gain political support for a more restrictive welfare state.

How convinced are we by this argument, by these visualizations?
- What is the definition of "redistribution"?
- Not taking into account different institutions

### Mechanisms
How does racial diversity affect levels of redistribution in practice?
- direct channel
    - voters perceive minority groups as over-represented among beneficiaries of welfare programs
    - altruism is conditional on shared group membership
    - opposition to spending rooting in a distaste for helping members of out-groups can trump opposition to retrenchment rooted in a voter's position as a beneficiary of social transfers.

=> Support for spending cuts increase

- indirect channel: Roemer paper: why the poor do not expropriate the rich
    - voters dislike outsiders, this dislike is latent, they engage with politics thinking about other issues
    - parties will "play the race card" and activate this latent dislike to their advantage

### How does this affect the "birth" of the welfare state in the United States
- How did the US set up the welfare state? 
    - ended up much smaller, and more restrictive, than in Europe
- France: When the welfare state was being set up, **the welfare state expanded generously and in an all encompassing way.**

### How does racial fractionalization explain lower distribution in the US
Three ages of the US welfare state:
1. Birth (1920s - 1945) --> small, exclusionary (racist) welfare state
2. Expansion (1945 - 1980s) --> expanded to cover some of the gaps, but mostly patchwork solutions due to low demand (structural racism)
3. recalibration (1990s onward) --> what is the role for race and diversity today?

#### Proto-ideologies
values, beliefs, opinions, etc that politicians can build on to create political advantage

## Europe
Given Immigration-Induced diversity in Europe, is the welfare state in trouble?


### Convincing Argument?
- Institutional arrangements allow for group identification across lines other than race/ethnic background, which undermines demand for in-group preference in redistribution.
    - prevents as effective use of race cards in europe
