Today: Class discussion of assigned readings

### Ansell (2014)
- research question: does home ownership price appreciation affect demand for redistribution (broadly defined)
- theory: yes or no because...
- empirical design: randomly vary exposure to varying levels of X and see how Y changes.
- empirical predictions: if more X then more Y
- Results: Yes or no, and why


What assumptions does this add to:
- Assumption 3: public policy has redistributive effects, and people know if it benefits them or not.
    - price appreciation affects people's interest in redistribution
    - addition: social insurance with redistributive consequences
- Assumption 2: people care about income maximization
    - addition: people care about minimizing income variance (insurance against this)

TLDR: Demand for and support for social insurance varies with risk exposure.

### Types of evidence:

How do we isolate the change that we're interested in?
Ansell uses panel data and creates a measure of changes in levels of support, rather than simply levels.

- Causal:
experimental evidence where we're able to control all variables to isolate the impact of the variable of interest.
"One perfect test"
- Observational:
using a number of weak tests to try to isolate the impact of the variable of interest.

### Three ages of the welfare state
1. birth/creation of the welfare state (1920s-1950s)
2. expansion of the welfare state (1950s-1980s)
3. recalibration of the welfare state (1990s-present)

### Bartels (2005)

- Research Question: Why people in lower tax brackets support Bush tax cuts, GIVEN that they care about inequality?
- Theory: Yes or no, and why
- Empirical Design: How do we isolate the change that we're interested in?
- Empirical Predictions: If more X then more Y
- Results: Yes or no, and why


What assumptions does this challenge:
- Assumption 3: People know if policies benefit them or not
    - People don't know if policies benefit them or not
