### Understandnig the missing left turn!
Built a simple model to understand with the simple assumptions.

### Outline
1. Cramer proposes to add the following micro-foundations:
    - "Social identity fused with notions of distributive justice"
2. Stostad: argues that there is no suvhc this thing as an objective level of inequality that people can "learn about" [and react to], instead people interpret the world through fairness lenses:
    - "Beliefs about the fairness of the status quo affet how people perceive levels of inequality"
3. How can we combine these insights with the plausible assumption that people care about their material self-interest?

### Cramer
- Ethnographic study of Wisconsin
- Found Urban/rural divide
- People seem to reason as members of a group, and their understanding of a group is socially constructed.
- Rural people feel like they are being treated unfairly by political/urban elites.
- Social identity fused with notions of distributive justice:
    - organize society in groups
    - apply principles of justice
    - come to the conclusion that society is unfair
- pushing back against the critique of the idea that people are not smart enough to understand the implications of tax policy.

How does this amend the simple model constructed earlier?

### Assumption 1
Original: People care about their material self-interest, specifically they care about income maximization.
Adjustment: People care about their material self-interest, but they also care about the material self-interest of their group.

### Stostad
This is a "Does X cause Y?" paper
Participants given information on the income distribution and political context of "Surveyland"
- groups were distributed across 2 groups:
    - fair group: given descriptions of surveyland framing fairness of income distribution
    - unfair group: given descriptions of surveyland framing unfairness of income distribution
- results: describing society as unfair increases the participants estimates of the top 10% income share by 11%.
- fairness beliefs function as a mental map that help people form policy preferences in a complicated world.
