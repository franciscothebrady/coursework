### Moving on (1)

We have discussed what type of policies would best address rising income and wealth inequality considering what we know about the causes of income inequality

### At least 3 broad types of policies
- pre-distribution policies that affect market income inequality
    - often explicitly redistributive: take from those who have more (in the form of taxes) or take the form of regulations that penalize the rich.
    - many are not explicitly redistributive, even if they can have egaliatarian implications
        - an example of this is anti-trust policy
- the welfare state as a bundle of social programs involving some form of direct or indirect cash transfers
    - public insurance (or social solidarity)
    - social solidarity: government intervention into situations where market outcomes would be too expensive for individuals to bear.
    - institutional design will matter to understand the extent to which social solidarity will be redistributive.
- the welfare state as a bundle of policies that affect markets ability to produce unequal/inegalitarian outcomes

### Politics of Redistribution

Motivating puzzle for this sequence: The missing left turn

- Incomes of the top 1% and the bottom 50% have been diverging
- Is public opinion changing in favor of increasing the LEVEL of redistribution?
- Plotting the Gini coefficient before tax and after tax, you can see that distance between the two lines has been relatively constant over time, although the average level of Gini has been increasing.
- In GSS (General Social Survey) data, the question "Do you think that the government ought to concern itself with reducing income differences between the rich and the poor?" has been relatively stable over time.

Is there any evidence that left-wing populist parties are doing better politically?
- not really

### What is the (implicit) model underpinning the missing left turn puzzle?
- assumptions about human behavior? Institutional design?
Assumptions:
- People care about their economic self-interest. They care about maximizing their own income.

### To answer this questions, let's try to build a simple model that would predict a positive relationship between rising inequality and rising support for redistribution.
The first model that's used is:
Test of a rational theory of the size of government (Allan Melzer and Scott Richard, 1983)
Online summary: https://adambrown.info/p/notes/meltzer_and_richards_a_rational_theory_of_the_size_of_government
- Taxes are flat
- Taxes are redistributive and transfered after tax according to the income groups share of the population.
- Theory is based on the assumption that people will prefer the tax rate that will maximize their own income.
- Assumption 2 is that taxes are redistributive, when the government intervenes, it will take more from the rich than it takes from the poor.
- As inequality increases, the poor will want to increase taxes
- Assumption 3: People know that public policy (taxes) is redistributive.

### This is our framework

Assumption 0: The USA is a majoritarian democracy
Assumption 1: People care about their economic self-interest, specifically, they care about income maximization.
Assumption 2: Public policy has redistributive consequences
Assumption 3: Public policy public policy has redistributive consequences and people
know if it benefits them or not.
Assumption 4: politics is mostly about economic policy (taxes and redistribution)

The Political Economy of Ownership: Housing Markets and the Welfare State
- Research question: What is the relationship between attitudes towards personal wealth and support for redistribution?
- Theory: Valuable assets (housing) act as "self insurance", which affects attitudes towards social insurance (redistribution).
