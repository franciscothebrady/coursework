### wrap up from last time
- we live in an unequal, socially stratified society
- but we also hold egalitarian ideals

the solution here is a meritocracy

### who might want to take a redistribution class
- folks who think the system is flawed

maybe the topic is left-wing, but the class is not

How so? 
the goal is to explain:
- change over time [comparison within the same country, across time]
- difference across countries [comparison across countries, at the same time]

the theories discussed are based on clear assumptions that people across the political spectrum can agree on.
- e.g. people tend to prefer more income to less income

### political economy of inequality and redistribution
political economy:
- the interaction between politics and economics
    - the material/economic factors that shape political outcomes
    - the political factors that shape economic outcomes
- tools of economics (formal models and econometrics) applied ot the study of politics
    - two main tools: formal models and econometrics

Formal model: attempt to descrbie a complicated theory into an equation. by definition it is a simplification. by laying everything out in an equation you can check them for internal consistency.

- this means that we will only cover a specific flavor of social science:
    - it is not the only flavor
    - it can be narrow at times:
        - materialist
        - positivist - we can measure things
        - methodologically individualist
        - mostly focused on income distribution
### a positivist and materialist approach to social facts
- a paradigm that relies on measurement and reason, on the assumption that knowledge is revealed from a neutral and measurable (quantifiable) observation of activity, action or reaction.
- positivism implicitly assumes that if something is not measurable in this way, it cannot be known for certain.

### drwabacks of positivism
because this appraoch fucosus on what and what can be measured:
- has a hard time thinking out of the boc.
- mostly focused on economic inequality defined as inequality in terms of income and wealth

this approach fancies itself agnostic and scientific:
- it is blind to its own contribution to the reproduction of inequality

### Statistical discrimination
why do employers and others discriminate? because of prejudice/stereotyping
- prejudice occurs when an employer or other agent has an irrational dislike for a specific group, which is not n objective characteristics that could be relecant in a specific employment situation
- stereotyping occus when an employer views some groups as less suitable employees that other groups are, even though there are few solid grounds for holding such a view.
- presented as irrational
- statistical discrimination arises when groups differ statistically in their distributions on characteristics relevant in a given situation. For example, men may on average take fewer sick days than women do. An employers, faced with hiring either a man or a woman, may treat the man and the woman as representative of their groups, rather than trying to make an assessment of how many sick days the specific man versus the specific woman is likely to take.
- presented as rational

### economic theories of statistical discrimination 
pros: 
- theories generate competing and testable predictions 
- theories that tend to do a great job at explaining differences across individuals and change over time.
    - this is a feat to celebrate (social science is hard)
cons:
- narrows definition of prejudice: it is what is irrational
- as a resuilt, in this line of work, prejudice tends to be a residual concept
- this has implications for social critique:
    - an "agnostic/objective" theory shapes how we interpret the status quo.

### this week
- before moving away from normative issues, we will spend one week discussing the _should_.
- should we carea bout (economic inequality) inequality? [today]
- should the response to economic inequality be economic redistribution? [next thursday]

### inequality as a descriptive fact
- we need something that captures the intensity of the ranking
- the extent to which the ranking is unequal
- we also want to capture the dispersion of people among the ranked categories (and characterize a given distribution as more unequal than another)

### measuring inequality is hard
- what social categories to pick?
- how to measure ranking? (multi-dimensional, not just about income, but also about wealth, education, health, etc.)
- how to weight the ranking/distance relative to the distribution of people among the categories?

### compromise solution: focus on the distribution of income and wealth.
- gini coefficient: a measure of the inequality of a distribution, a value of 0 expressing total equality and a value of 1 maximal inequality.
- gini captures that difference between perfect equality and the real world.
- what is your share of population relative to your share of income.

### another approach focuses on percentile ratios
- another way to measure inequality is to look at the distribution of income across percentiles
- one metric is the ratio of the income of the 90th percentile to the income of the 10th percentile
- what exactly does it measure?
    - this is a ratio of income levels
    - describes the multiple of income that the 90th percentile has relative to the 10th percentile
- another method to use is using the average income in the top decile relative to the average income in the penultimate bottom decile.

### this method makes choices on what to focus on, answering the questions from the beginning
- what social categories to pick?
    - none, ignore and start with individuals
- how to measure ranking?
    - in capitalist economies, income/wealth are a decent numeraire. (proxy for restige, status, etc)
- how to weight the ranking/distance relative to the distribution?
    - depends, there are several measures to pick from

### takeaways
- inequality is the deviation from the (moral) principle of equality 
- for social scientists, it is first and foremost a statistical concept
    - designed to enable comparison over time and across countries

important people:
- kuznets, atkinson, piketty, saez, zucman

### takeaways 2
- compromise solution is imperfect but has some advantages
    - gini is a summary measure 
    - relatively recent 
    - easy to compare 

### why should we care?
why do positivist social scientists care?
- the trajectories of inequality across countries and over time are similar
- this is despite different political structures etc
- reversal of trend in the 1970s (inequality was declining but started to increase from 1970 on)
- comparison of US and european social democracies
- is it fair to compare the us with other countries
    - maybe a better comparison is us v. india
- in general comparisons are made with western european, post-industrial economies
    - similar economic systems

### what is post-industrial?
- pre-industrial
    - pre-1830s
    - household production
    - agricultural sector dominates
- iundustrial
    - 1930-1970s
    - factory, vertically integration corporation
    - manufacturing dominates
- post-industrial
    - 1970s-present
    - global production and supply chains
    - service sector dominates
        - management of globalization
        - R&D, management sections of production
        - care and education industries
    - network and information economies
        - computer and other information technologies
