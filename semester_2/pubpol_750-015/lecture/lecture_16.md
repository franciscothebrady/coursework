### Economics

Why is the economics, return to human capital, and income inqeuality so different across more advanced economies

### Capitalism: some definitions

- an economic system in which:
    - private actors own and control property
    - inputs and outputs are exchanged through market-based decentralized modes of allocation:
        - demand and supply freely set prices in markets (many players, free entry and exit, not too much product discrimination, full information on price, product quality, etc)
        - prices are the main signal

- an economic system that reaches efficiency because:
    - people are rational selfish actors (maximize profit, income, returns, etc)
    - competition (entry and exit, freedom to choose)
    - full information through a market mechanism that determines prices in a decentralized manner through interactions with buyers and sellers.
    - governments intervene in ways that buttress (i.e. do not undermine) these institutions

> some versions of capitalism take this definition more seriously than others -- some are more or less close to this ideal than others.

### adjustments

Labor markets:
- does labor truly have the right to exit the labor market?
- if not, what are the institutional solutions to avoid exploitation
- is exit not an option?

What are the solutions that labor has found to address this: Trade unions
- end of the 19th century - 1940 in europe
- because the reality does not match the ideal

### Sweden

In Sweden Unions were very efficient!
- lots of theories on why
- they were very powerful and able to go on strike, which was very costly

Problems: Powerful unions can increase labor costs
- this might create an inflationary spiral
- what is the institutional solution to this problem?

Solution: Centralize wage bargaining
- unions negotiate with employer associations to arrive at a set on wage increase
- bargains that cover everyone instead of separately negotiating for wage increases for each firm
- also agreed to not go on strike
- solves the collective action problem


Note: Another solution to this problem is to destroy the unions

### Prerequisites on the employer side
Trade Federations
- institutions that aggregate preferences of employers
- unproductive firms may lose from these arrangements, they will not be able to compete with more productive firms that are able to afford negotiated pay rises.

Note: this requires a lot of coordination on the employer side. This is not easy to achieve, and in the united states is is not done very well. Lots of organization on the employer side is subsidized by rich businessman like the koch brothers.

### implications of centralized-wage bargaining for the labor market? Is it still a market?
- wage (growth) is taken out of the market
- employers can compete on other margins (amenities)

### Centralized-wage bargaining in Sweden
- how did it emerge? What problem was it a solution to?
    - pages 10,13, and pages 15-18
- implcations for wage inequality?
    - wage negotiations close the gap between higher paid and lower paid workers through guaranteed minimum increases.
    - productivity shocks don't reverberate in the income distribution in the same way

- why did this institution change in the 1980s?
    - when one institution changes, sometimes it can happen at the same time as other institutions
    - globalization
    - higher skilled workers moved first, breaking away from larger unions in order to negotiate for themselves

- implications for wage inequality?
    - different unions bargain for different wages
    - fragmentation of the labor market
    - wage inequality increases


### What scenario in the united states could lead to employers to push for centralized wage bargaining?
- health care markets

### Some pf the problems faced by a capitalist entrepeneur
**(what problems does centralized wages bargaining help solve?)**
- find funds
- **find the right workers**
    - **train in-house and avoid poaching**
    - **poach from other firms without a labor cost escalation**
- **get workers to cooperate (work in the interest of the firm)**
- **turn uncertainty into insurable risk**
    - **keep labor costs (wages and benefits) under control**
    - be able to control costs in a downturn
    - limit cash flow issues in the form of sudden borrowing costs
    - develop long term relationships with suppliers and customers

### Examples of other institutions that helps overcome a commitment problem?
- how to bind players to agreements across space and time

Example: Tenure
- two players who want the good of a university but don't trust each other
- tenure arises as a benefit to avoid poaching
- research is risky and long term

### Some of the problems faced by a capitalist entrepreneur
- **find funds**
- **limit cash flow issues in the form of sudden borrowing costs**

### two big families of solutions to the financing problem
- raise funds through capital markets
     - people who need money can sell shares of their company
- ask banks for a loan
    - people who need money need a set of actors who are more patient about returns: "patient capital"

> What solutions are used to dominate in Germany?
- larger banks, usually banks owned with large ownership share by the state
- more patient capital, stakeholder model, and longer term corporate governance.
- more fundraising through banks, and a more long term corporate governance in pursuit of stakeholder value.

> In the United States?
- evolution of corporate governance rewarded short term increases (by compensating CEOs with stock options)
- shareholder capitalism: CEO main interest is shareholder value (short term interests)
- more fundraising through capital markets, and a more short term corporate governance in pursuit of shareholder value.

> What are the implications for corporate governance?
- extent to which the shareholder model converges between the patient and the short term model

### Institutions Complement Each Other
- countries that have high stock market capitalization have low employment protections (liberal market economies)
    - less generous unemployment benefits
    - general skills acquired through a semi-private education system

- countries that have high bank capitalization have high employment protections (coordinated market economies)
    - generous unemployment system
    - on the job training through apprenticeships and vocational programs
    - competitive shocks will have very different effects on the labor market

### SO what
- liberal market economies are much better at disruptive innovation (tesla)
    - winner takes all outcomes
    - silicon valley ecosystems
- coordinated market economies are much better at incremental process improvement (bmw)

### Policy implications
- you cannot just import solutions from other countries
- what you do in one instutional realm will have consequences in other realms
- you must get to know america's brand of capitalism intimately to understand how to most effectively change it:
    - anti-trust
    - try to organize firms faved with rising benefit costs (healthcare)
