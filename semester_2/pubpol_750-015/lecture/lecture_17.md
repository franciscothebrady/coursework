### argument

capitalism comes in different flavors and america's flavor is:
    - prone to higher levels of income inequality
    - very good at turning competitive pressue into high levels of income inequality

### this time
Talking about the role of political institutions
Political instutitions come in difference flabors and american's flavor is:
    - prone to higher levels of (disposable) income inequality
    - very good at failing to take a left turn, even in the face of rising inequality


### institutions

systems of established rules that structure social interactions

some instutions:
- to shape labor markets (unions)
- to shape buying and selling of funds (capital markets)

### a few truisms about institutions
- groups are defined by their institutions: they share rules of interaction that "make sense" to every group member and cannot be disposed of by individuals in isolation (you can't pick the rules)
- some institutions are more formal/visible/that others
    - formal: constitutions, laws, etc
    - informal: norms, customs, etc
- **institutions are durable for a combination of reasons**:
    - they are "sanctioned" by a third-party enforcer (social pressure, the justice system, etc)
    - they create stable expectations of behavior (they impose form and consistency on what would otherwise be a big mess)
        - coordination games (game theory)
    - a powerful actor/majority benefits from the institution, those who do not benefit are not powerful enough (power is itself devined by the rules!) to change it.
        - who benefits?


### Week 11: political institutions, i.e. institutions that distribute the power to make the rules
- electoral institutions
- systems of governance
- the state

### institutions are not boring
- if you do not notive institutions and fail to identify/diagnose
    - how they incentivize actors
    - why they are hard to change
- then you might be wasting a lot of your energy, applying it to the wrong things, at the wrong time in the wrong places.
- changing an institution is hard (life long endeavor) but it can have far reaching consequences!
- again, very hard to change, yet they do change, why? [often the best puzzles in social science are about institutional change]

### the fundamental rules of american political democracy

Representative democracy
- institutional arrangement in which individuals acquire power to make decisions by means of a competitive struggle for the people's vote. (Schumpeter, 1942)

- what if it was a random draw?
    - as in ancient athens
    - no political parties!

### semi-presidential system
France:
- prime minister and president
- national assembly + senate
- only stable if they receive a majority in the national assembly
    - national assembly can have a vote of no confidence
- the president appoints the government
- the president can call for new elections of the national assembly

### proportional representation
- why are coalition governments more common in PR systems?
    - because the number of seats in the legislature is proportional to the number of votes
    - so it is very rare for a single party to have a majority
    - so they have to form coalitions
    - this is in contrast to winner-take-all systems

### trying to explain
- why are there fewer parties in some systems than others?
    - number of (effective) parties
Majoritarian rule (SMD + plurality)
- if you have a lot of strategic voters, might reinforce the 1st and 2nd party
- supply and demand converge to a smaller number of parties
- candidates strategically don't run as third-party candidates
Proportional representation
- PR systems have more parties
- the penalty for expressive voting is lower

### Duverger's Law
- Electoral rules affects the party system
- SMD + plurality -> 2 party system
- PR -> multi-party system
