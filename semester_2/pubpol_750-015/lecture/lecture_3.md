### martin feldstein - we shouldn't care about inequality

should we care even if we do not care about empirical puzzles?
- seeing increasing income inequality, especially in the US
- inequality increases much faster in the united states
- if you disagree with feldman, try also to think about the type of empirical study one could conduct:
    - to either disprove his main point
    - or to convince him that he should care

#### minimum wage 
- MF frames the minimum wage as a problem, because businesses can't afford to hire people in order to train them at the prevailing minimum wage
    - MF claims there is a moral hazard with the minimum wage
- MF contends that individuals will pick unemployment benefits over working at the minimum wage
    - Free rider problem
- MF only notices one type of redistribution
    - claims that poverty is not well measured because of in-kind benefits

Arguments for caring about inequality:
Utilitarian/Consequentialist Arguments:
- higher incomes likely feeds into more political inequality
    - higher income people advocate and participate policitally at different rates than lower income people
- economic inequality could lead to political instability
    - order (to conduct business, to exchange goods and services) is a public good
    - what sort of metric of inequality would be useful to measure this?
- MF is making a moral judgement with his attitude on inequality
    - normative
Moral Arguments:
- maximizing utility: consumption at lower levels of income is more valuable than consumption at higher levels of income
    - diminishing marginal utility

### data
- is it true that inequality harms growth?
- disposable income by income deciles over the past 20 years
    - has shown that over time the income of the top deciles have increased faster than the bottom deciles

What type of data would you want to see?
- MF cares about asolute income change and poverty, what do we care about?

### why should we care?
- inequality as a diagnostic tool (same way we think about temperature)
    1. worrying evidence that the increasing inequality is a symptom of a larger problem (economies are not working as well as they should)
    - care about
    2. worrying evidence of impending doom (moral consequentialist argument) 
        - social breakdown, political instability, etc.
- change in earning deciles in the united states
    - the top 1% - 10% have seen the largest changes (increases) in income over the past 30 years (since reagan)

We care about unfair inequality not inequality per se
- to read a conclusion, the inequality data we have discussed up to now is not usually enough, 

### why should we care?
- instrumental reasons
    - economic growth
    - political stability
    - social trust
    - health
    - crime
    - social mobility
- not always easy to prove inequality is to blame
- inequality is a useful starting point (summary statistic)
    - evidence of human societies ability to produce vastly different political and moral outcomes
        - care about inequality as one point of entry into the study opf socio-economic change.

### switching gears
- most political debates are less about inequality and more about redistribution

### what if the remedy is worse than the disease?
- natural rights libertarians abhor redistribution
- empirical libertarians see a role for parsimonious welfare state whose main objective is poverty relief
(this is an old (20th cent) debate that libertarians have lost)

### we are going to ask a different question
(one that is more charcteristic of your generation)
- not do we need redistribution, but what kind of redistribution do we need?

### redistribution
should the respond to economic inequality be economic redistribution?

Fraser Nancy. 1995. "From Redistribution to Recognition? Dilemmas of Justice in a 'Postsocialist' Age." New Left Review. 1/212

fraser makes three points:
- two types of social justice fights
    - socio-economic injustice and cultural injustice
- the methods and goals of one type are in tension with the other (do you agree)
- two types of remedies for each type of injustice
    - affirmative and transformative
    - transformative remedies (instead of affirmative ones) on both fronts is the way forward

### discussion
- some responses argue that a lot of the cultural injustices express themselves on an economic dimension
- someone else brought up that these two distinctions do not take power into account

### 2005 riots in france 
diagnosis:
were they:
- poverty riots? (one view)
- muslim riots? (american view?)
- race riots?
Depending on your diagnosis you might identify a different remedy:
Remedies:
- redistribution (which types?)
- recognition (which types?)
- transformation (which types?)

### bottom line
- this class is about economic redistribution as a solution to economic inequality
- we will discuss the conditions for transformative solutions >> affirmative solutions >> nothing
- this means we overlook issues of recognition and the redistribution of cultural power/status

### next week
- long duree
- focus on the decline of inequality
