Assignment 2
- Will put more weight on the substantive discussion part of the rubric
    - generalizability. Be more detailed.
    - What would be the implications for the original argument, the findings.
        - If the data shows [this], the this means that [something else]
- Will be easier to do because you have to compare and contrast two studies (options 2 and 3)
- Note that if you are not interested in becoming comfortable with quantitative studies and would prefer a different assignment, there is option 1.

### New Sequence
Moving from the causes of inequality to the politics of inequality.

"Why has democracy failed to reduce inequality?" - Shechter (2018)

### we've focused on demand-side factors (voters)
- week 6: voters don't just care about inequality, but care about risk and income shocks. so they support policies that provide social insurance that have redistributive consequences.
    - this is shown by the experiment with housing price changes and changes in support for redistributive policies.
- week 6: citizens lack information about how government policies affect inequality and their own incomes.
- week 7: inequality has no concrete meaning without relative grounding. not all voters interpret an increase in inequality as something worth correcting.

### Demand side factors
- voter demand for redistribution is lower than one would expect in light of the facts of inequality.

### supply side factors
- supply creates its own demand: redistribution is lagging because the supply of pro-redistribution ideology and policy options is lagging.

> Who are the actors in charge of supplying these "goods"
- political parties, politicians

### outline
- the importance of supply-side factors
- supply-side explanation of the missing left turn: the left has been missing in actions
- why?
    - peter hall (1993) [background on the neo-liberal turn]

### Representative Democracy
Schumpeter (1942)
- Representative Democracy = A method rather than an ideal.
- "set of institutions that realize the common good by making the people itself decide issues through the electionsof individuals who are to assemble in order to carry out its will."

- The democratic method: "the institutional arrangement for arriving at political decisions in which individuals acquire the power to decide by means of a competitive struggle for the people's vote."
    - individuals acquire power!
    - by competing for your vote

> Schumpeter is considered the father of the spatial models we use to understand democracy.

### Downsian Model
- Spatial model
- parties A and B compete for votes
- Assumes rational citizens
- Median voter model
    - parties will converge to capture the vote of the pivotal voter (50% + 1)
- Assume you can rank people along a single dimension (left-right)
- Spatial models are used to understand the behavior of political parties and voters.
- equilibrium assumes political leaders follow the median voter.

tldr: we should think about the method of selection for ambitious people.

### Schumpeter Model
- Very different from Downsian Model
- Competitive struggle is driven by political leadership (who decides to run), instead of political deference to given voter preferences.
- Party management and political bosses are the essence of politics
- voters have limited initiative: all they can do is choose is to support the one they dislike the least.

Key points:
- people are not in control of the choice set
- presented with options that they may not have approved of in advance, but they have to choose from them.
- explaining which options end up on the menu of options requires a different model than the downsian model.
- people have "bifurcated minds", not always rational choosers.

progressive taxation is being sold to voters. framed as punishment of undeserving rich. progressive taxation is thus a project imposed from the top-down, not a prior "demand" representatives are responding to.

- this requires a different model

### Model

- assumes non-rational voters
- "voters follow the leader"

### Political Parties
- once you acknoledge that democracy is a way of solving problems, you can see that political parties are important objects that make it easier to solve those problems.
- the emphasis is on parties and note voters.
parties, are organizations that:
- get things done between elections (bills passed)
- career planning: organize the competitive struggle
- get elected (organize voters)

### supply-side explanation ofthe missing left turn: the left has been missing in action!

#### Hypothesis:
the left has been largely complicit in the policies that lead to rising inequality and financial degregulation and has therefore been missing in action for the past 20 years.
(Schechter, 2018)

- Schumpeter would say that left-wing parties chose inequality increasing policies that voters would not have thought of or approved in advance.
- There are some pro-redistribution policies that are no longer on the table, and voters do not have the option to choose them.

### Questions:
1. Why did left-wing party leadership agree to such policies (e.g. globalization/free trade and financial deregulation)?
2. Why are some policies no longer part of the policy choice set?
