### data 
mobility data 
- cross country rankings in intergenerational mobility
    - how big is the coefficient of the variable on parental income predicting your own income.
    - positive coefficient means that the higher your parents income, the higher your income
    - denmark has a lower coefficient, meaning that your parent's income is less predictive of your income.
    - brazil has the highest coefficient
    - US is lower than brazil, but with a much higher confidence interval
- educational mobility:
    - parent-child correlation in years of schooling
    - ethiopia has the lowest correlation
    - US has a higher correlation than ethiopia
note: this data is pre-2008
- countries with lower mobility are also the countries with higher inequality
- mean rate of absolute mobility by cohort
    - absolute mobility is the probability that a child will earn more than their parents
    - 1950 bohort: .8
    - 1980 cohort: .5
    - chetty: finds that increasing GDP to 1940s rates alone would not restore absolute mobility to 1950s levels
        - they find that applying levels of distribution to 1950s levels would bring absolute mobility to 70% of 1950s levels

### week 3

key empirical facts that will drive our inquiry in the next few weeks
fact 1:
- over the long term, we have pretty good income on the top 10%, because they were historically the only ones rich enough to pay taxes
- based on the national accounting identity (national income), we can then estimate an approximation of the bottom 50% share of income.

fact 2:
- large decrease in first half of the 20th century (~1950s - 1970s)
- this is called the great compression (in income inequality)

### wealth
what is income?
- labor income: workers earn income by working
    - wages, salaries
    - bonuses
- capital income: owners of assets earn capital income due to their property
    - dividends
    - interest on savings
    - capital gaints (increase in value of assets)
- what about pensions? unemployment benefits? employer contributions to health insurance? employer payroll taxes?

> there is a lot of distributional intricacy in figuring out the right measure for income, and this data.

### what is wealth?
- income allowed to accumulate in the form of a valued asset:
    - house
    - equity
    - financial products

ex.
1. buy a house for 10,000, minus 8,000 in mortgage = net wealth of 2,000
2. capital gains (increase in value of the house/asset) + 10,000
3. 20,000 house minus 0 in mortgage = net wealth of 20,000
4. capital income the year you sell -- realized capital gains = +10,000

### income and wealth inequality, usa
fact 1: half of the US population has no real wealth
fact 2: the deconcentration of wealth (up to the 1980s) has benefited the other half of the population, especially the very top.

fact 3: the middle and upper middle class has real estate, the very top has business equity and financial assets.
    - top 1% has bery different portfolio distribution than the rest of the population: non-retirement financial assets and business equity.

fact 4: more and more income is being accumulated, not spent
    - 1978 british wealth stock = 300% of national income, 2014 = +500% of national income.
    - the pace at which assets are appreciating is faster than the pace at which income is growing.

### wealth inequality
wealth inequality is much higher than income inequality
for income: top 1% = 10% of income
for wealth: top 1% = 20% of wealth
- but general trends are roughly the same

in the remainder of the class we will focus on:
- the return of inequality, why?
    - income: skill-biased technological change
    - the nature of capitalism to produce inequality

### this week
- overview of the big picture before the 1970s
    - what explains the great de-concentration?

### Scheidel 2017
- the great leveler
- together the 2 world wars of the 20th century caused what economists studying the distribution of income and wealth have dubbed the great compression, resulting in massive leveling.
- mechanisms through which mass warfare decreases economic inequality.

### 1910 through late 1970s
- what is happening at this point that disrupts the trend of increasing inequality?
    - WWI, Spanish Flu, Great Depression, WWII
- notable that this decline happens across many countries

### mechanisms through which mass warfare decreases economic inequality?
- destruction: rich people have assets that are destroyed in war. poor people have no assets.
- population loss: distribution of income and wealth might change
- taxes: war is expensive, so governments need to raise taxes. it is easier to tax the rich.
