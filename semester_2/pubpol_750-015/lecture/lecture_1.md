Area of Research  
When income is increasingly unevenly distributed, you would expect that to benefit farther left candidates, but that has not been the case. 

Course objective: 
- how to identify quantitative papers on redistribution 
- how to understand these papers 

Week 15 topic: 
- time to review a specific topic 
- if you have strong preferences email
    - gender
    - race but this is a biggie and there is a separate class on this topic. 

## do you have to be left-wing to enjoy this class? 
no, but being interested in inquality and redistribution is not like being interested in the weather or monetary policy.
normative issues are important. this clas si nto about normative issues and is focused more on quantitative empirical topics.

## the political economy of inequality and redistribution in post-industrial democracies

inequality
- do you revignoize ?

doug massey, categorically unequal
1. allocation of people to social categorices.
- these can be ascribed (birth), or achieved (allocation based on test)
2. institutionalization of practices that allocate resources unequally across these categories. 
- "because i am in social category Y, I have the "right" to X."
- the institutions that compel worthiness
3. ranking: the institutionalization of practices that make membership in some categories "better" than others.
- implies that the resource is cardinal (more is always better, so those who have more are better)
- one might disagree, but the simple act of expressing disagreement is a form of ranking. conceding that there is a heirarchy of skill. 

you need boxes to put people in and some boxes hae more than others. 

What are those institutions? 
- education: ascribe deservingness to certain people 
- immigration: different perceptions of value for immigrants from specific countries than others 
- institution of the market: pricing value you can generate for firms

## what does an egalitarian society look like?
[fill in notes from this slide]

## meritocracy
society where inequalities are justified because they are based/proportional to merit.
How meritocratic is system?
- if you say very, you might be right-wing
- if you say it is not, you might be left-wing

## what does it look like to have a truly meritocratic system?
(originally coined as a negative term)

## michae'l young's egalitarian utopia 
- [see slides]
- this type of egalitarian utopia is associated with the left 

## who might want to take a class on inequality and redistribution?
is this a left-wing class?
Maybe the topic of this class is left-wing ... but the approach taken in this class sidesteps the question.
