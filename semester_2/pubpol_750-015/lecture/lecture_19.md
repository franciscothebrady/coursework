### Today: Other ways in which the US did not win the institutional lottery?

Hacker, Hertel-Fernandez, Pierson, Thelen (2019)
- The American Political Economy: A Framework and Agenda for Research

#### Institutional Set up
- Different veto points in institutional in US compared to other countries
- Federal, bicameral with both houses having absolute veto
- US has the highest number of veto points:
    - President
    - Senate
    - House
    - Supreme Court
    - Federalism
- Horizontal separation of power and vertical separation of power

The cameral structure is different in the US compared to other countries. Equal power set up is unique.

#### Hypothesis, empirical prediction, empirical tests?
- bicameral structure in US leads to less legislation being passed.
- as inequality increases, which needs more legislation to address, the equal bicameral structure.
- this leads to status quo bias
- Each player who has a veto point faces a different type of incentives.
- One way to solve coordination problems is parties, allows coordination across different veto points.
- unicamereralism to strong bicameralism --> welfare state generosity index
--> upper chamber disagrees with lower chamber and resists changes to the status quop.
- test: in terms of both types of cameral structures, both trend toward a welfare state, but it gets more generous faster in a unicameral system.
- question: in which type of cameral will you have a better match between what people want and what happens in policy?
    - what is the correlation between public opinion and policy outcomes (from high to low)
"Bicameralism and Policy Responsiveness to Public Opinion"
Lawrence Ezrow, Michele Fenzl, Timothy Hellwig
First published: 23 February 2023

- measure policy responsiveness to public opinion
- find the unicameral systems respond to their measure of public opinion more than bicameral systems.

### Unitary State
- what is it: highly centralized governmental authority, in wnhich any government below the national government is dependent upon the central government.
- centralized decision makers and efficient bureaucracy
- none/weak/dependent governmental subunits
- less public participation

### Federal State
- independently elected subnational and national governmental institutions
- a constitution that guaranteess the sovereignty of subnational units and distributes responsibilities between the national and subnational governments
- institutions that represent the subnational preferences in the national political institutions (senate represents states to the national government)

- federalism involves the division of power between multiple geographically defined and nested levels of government.
    - each level is relatively autonomous

### American exceptionalism
- highly fragmented, many elected bodies, including in the judiciary
- at least three layers, each nearly as developed as the top layer -- no level is ceremonial

### Comparison to other countries
- Locus of authority for key policies
- US: local institutions matter a lot
- UK/France: national institutions decide policy

| Criminal Justice | Police  | Prosecution | Judges | Zoning | *Income Support* |
|------------------| ------  | ----------- | ------ | ------ | --------------   |
| National         | UK, FR  | UK, FR      | UK, FR | UK, FR | UK/FR/DE         |
| State/Province   | CA, DE  | CA, DE      | CA, DE | CA     | CA, US           |
| Local            | US      | US          | US     | US, DE | US               |

- US is among the lowest share of central government revenue, along with Canada and Switzerland.

### Sum up
- local elected officials are in charge of important things
    - police, justice, education
- they are also in charge of raising funds to pay for these things

### Institutional characteristics of federal states
- most public service and benefits are consumed locally 
- the locus of authority:
    - which level raises revenue
    - which level spends revenue

### Primary and Secondary Education: Comparison to UK
- Great Britain: national government is in charge of education
- UK: Department of Education
    - makes all decisions, allocates financial resources, funded throuh general taxes.
- UK: Local authorities are elecetd but cannot raise taxes or decide curriculum content
- UK: Recent reforms have introduced school autonomy
- UK: No overlap between what is provided to a school at the local level and what the local level wants.

### US: Education
- US: education is controlled by states, local school boards
- US: states delegate to local school boards. local school boards are elected.
- US: municiaplities can raise taxes to fund schools, some goes to states
- US: states redistribute resources across school districts but not enough to equalize across school districts.

### Zoning
- Single Family Zoning is only found in the US
- hyperconcentration of public housing in the US

### Comparison
- US is unique in the extent to which local governments are in charge of public services

### Municipalities
- Portgage, MI: Created as a separate municipality in 1963
- Toronto, CA: Forced to merge with other municipalities in 1998
- Since 2000, 777 new school districts or municipalities, following a process similar to Portage, MI

### Implications for public goods provision/redistribution
- local elected officials are in charge of important things
- they are also in charge of raising funds to pay for these things
- zoning regulations limit affordable housing in cities, unless hyperconcentrated
- exit is an option for the wealthy. create your own local unit

> All of this is important becuase of how it makes geography a key factor in shaping policy outcomes.

### Given this institutional set up:
- america's particular brand of federalism makes it relatively easy to engage in resource hoarding:
    - education is more of a club good than a public good (pick your club, dues vary)
    - tools to limit pooling and charge high entry fees are readily available (zoning, fiscal autonomy, fragmentation)
    - **no incentive** for the well-off to pool resources in an inclusive fashion: doing so means higher taxes for not better benefits.

### to sum up: three types of cities/towns
- high tax + good education + high housing price and rents :(because of demand + local taxes) + wealth accumulation
- low tax + bad education + low housing prices and rents + no wealth accumulation
- low to medium tax + segregated school system (public versus private) + ambiguous effect on housing prices and rents + ambiguous effect on wealth accumulation

### In contrast:
- unitary systems do not give you a choice but to share resources

### systemic implications
- for equal opportunity
    - all encompassing: affects life trajectories (where you are born matters)
    - biased implications even if actors themselves are not biased: unequal outcomes across racial groups are obtained even absent racist intent.
    - entrenched: rules reproduce themselves because over time, the well-off have no incentive to change them.

#### where one starts matters a lot
equalityofopportunity.org
- geography of upward mobility in the united states

#### Moving to opportunity
- 1994-1998
- 4,600 families
- 5 cities
- 3 groups
    - control group
    - low poverty group
    - high poverty group
- finding 1: people don't move to the best neighborhoods
    - people move to neighborhoods that are slightly better, but not the best
    - richer neighborhoods don't even have housing that would accept the vouchers
    - cultural and social capital networks to even facilitate moves
- finding 2: no economic impacts on mothers' income, mostly positive effect on their mental health
    - young men have a hard time
- finding 3: young movers have better outcomes
    - under 13 at move had larger impact on income

### to sum up
- where you live matters:
    - how do we know: because when people move out of certain neighborhoods into others, things improve
- not so easy to move "good" places:
- race predicts where you live
- moving had larger positive effects on whites that Blacks (maybe because of the above)

### Cons
