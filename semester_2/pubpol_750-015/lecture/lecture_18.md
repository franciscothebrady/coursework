### Duverger's Law
Two types:
- electoral system

Single Member Districts: 1 member represents one district

How to test:
- As size of districts increases, how many parties are there?

District Magnitude:
- As district magnitude increases, the closer you are to proportional representation.

TLDR:
- On average, as district magnitude increases, the number of parties increases.

### Why only two parties in the US?

- Other countries have more than 2 parties, why?
Case of UK:
    - Smaller parties benefit from SMD (Single Member Districts) + Plurality Rule
    - Scottish National Party - a concentrated population of people are able to win a majority in a single district, and even though they are a minority in the country, they are able to win a majority in the district, and thus win a seat in the parliament.
    - Had more parties to begin with
    - Liberal Democrats: One of the older parties that was initially in competition with the Conservative party, but the Labor party was able to move in and capture more representation.

Statement:
If electoral rule is SMD + Plurality Rule, it is **BAD** for a small party to have their vote evenly distributed across the districts.
- why?
    - Because they will never win a majority in any district, and thus never win a seat in the parliament.

### Rodden
If electoral rule is SMD + Pluralty Rule, it is **GOOD** for a large party to have their vote evenly distributed across the districts.

Takeaway:
- If you're a small party, you might want to concentrate support in a district, so you can capture a majority in that district. If you are a LARGE party, you want to spread your support evenly across the districts.
-- It is more efficient to win a district with 50% + 1 vote, than to win a district with 90% of the vote. (Democratic large majority wins in Urban districts)

### Problems
Why is this a problem for democrats in the United States?
- because of the educational realignment around party affiliation.
- education tracks with density of population
- this leads to concentrated democratic support in urban areas

### Duverger's Law
- Plurality Rule electoral systems tend to have two parties
- Voters do not want to waste their vote, so if they understand that the more extreme candidate will not win, they will vote for the more moderate candidate.

### Persson and Tabellini (2003)
- Divide spending by countries using majoritarian electoral system vs. proportional representation countries
- proportional representation countries have higher spending on social security and welfare spending, higher budget deficits, and larger government spending overall.

### why did some countries switch to proportional representation? 

America with SMD + Plurality is less likely to have left-wing part in power.
- left-wing party is in power less often

### Changing from SMD to Proportional Representation
why?
Norway:
- Prior to 1919, Labor part was consistently getting more votes than seats
    - they were a third party
    - concentrated in urban areas

Institutions:
    - some are winning from status qup
- switched to districts with larger seats assigned through list systems (proportional representation)
