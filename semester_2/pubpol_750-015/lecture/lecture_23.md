### The politics of wealth taxation

1. Primer on wealth inequality
- what is wealth?
    - income as a flow that you don't consumer that you're able to store in the form of a valued asset.
    - examples: housing, financial products
    - there is a legal framework that together codes things into capital (property law, contract law, etc.)
        - enforced by the state
        - code of capital: priority, durability, universality, convertability

### facts about distribution of wealth in post-industrial economies
- bottom 50% owns close to nothing
implication: wealth inequality is always much higher than income inequality
- since the 1960s the emergence of a patrimonial middle class: remaining 40% owns around a third of existing wealth --> this is a new phenomenon.
    - ~75% of this wealth is through housing and pensions
- since the 1980s, wealth accumulation is more unequal in the US

### Social meaning of wealth accumulation

Why do people want to accumulate wealth over their lifetime?
Why do people want to pass on wealth to their children?
- consumption smoothing (save now so you don't have to work when you're old)
- calvinist work ethic: wealth gives a sense of meaning and worth
- wealth provides power and status
- some combination of these

What asset encompases all of these things?
*Housing!*

### Motive 1: Bequest and the European Rentier
- Rentier: someone who does not deserve their wealth. Someone who does not work for their wealth.
In this type of society, the motive for wealth accumulation is:
- acummulate assets to pass on to your children
- this is a way to maintain your social status

#### Paper: Pikeety, Postel-Vinay, and Rosenthal (2013)
- Two categories of groups with positive wealth:
    - the rentiers: they live thanks to income produced by their inheritance, not their labor income
    - savers: they consume less than their labor income

- Find that paris from 1872 - 1927 was a "rentier society"
    - society dominated by groups who received and left large bequests
    - consumers at a level higher than what their own labor income would allow
    - rentiers made up about 10% of the population of parisians but owned 70% of aggregate wealth

- This changes in the run up to WWI
    - wars, debt defaults, inflation all decrease the wealth concentration in europe

conclusion: it's fair to tax a rentier!!!
- the ideal type narrative for the high tax agenda
