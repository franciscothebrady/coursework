### From last time
- reviewing models of market income inequality
How to:
- set up a model
- compare that model to the data

### Wage premia 
- fluctuation between high and low skill should explain the wage premia
- comparing college/high school supply over time

Based on the model:
- the supply of high skill relative to low skill workers is increasing, but the growth rate is not as steep as it has been historically.
- Wage premium is not increasing fast enough

### To sum up
- theory: assume skills-biased technological change
- hypothesis: part of the increase in labor income inequality comes from education/training having not "kept up" with technology.
- empirical evidence: using a simple 2 factor model, it does a surprisingly good job of explaining changes in returns to a college degree.
- note: model can be extended to include more than 2 "skills" (levels of educational attainment)
- policy implications: increase supply of high skill workers

### growth in real hourly wages by education and gender
- assume: educational attainment signals skills
- there are unobservable skills that reveal themselves over time
- our focus so far has been the difference between high school and college educated workers
    - for hs grads, wages increased from about 1960 to 1970, then started decreasing relative to the college educated cohort.

### Problems with the canonical model
- cannot explain why the tail of the labor income distribution is so long
- it's predictive power is not as good past 1992
    - under the assumption of skill-biased technological change, the wage premium to college education is too low.
- what explains the "recovery" (stop in wage declines) of high school educated workers in the 1990s?
- and recent increases in high school wage growth post 2008?

### how can we change the model to close the gap with the data?
- we need a model that can account for employment polarization
David Autor:
- showing changes in employment by occupational skill percentile
- note: they assume if you are low wage you are low skill
- comparing shares of employment in high and low skill jobs at three periods: 1980, 1990, 2000
- takeaways:
    - higher paid/skill job share growth rate decreased over time
    - lower paid/skill job share growth rate increased over time
    - middle paid/skill job share growth rate decreased over time

### How can we change the model to account for the discrepancy?
- solution: focus on tasks (routine or not) instead of skills (Autor, Acemoglu)

### Back to the model: the "routinization" hypothesis
- a task is a unit of work activity that produces outputs (good and services)
- employers allocate workers of a given skill level to different tasks depending on the "market price" of that worker-skill combination
    - there may be times when giving high skill workers a simple task financially, and other times when it makes more sense to give lower skilled workers more complex assignments.
- when it comes to technological change, there are different types of tasks:
    - those that can be replaced by a new technology (e.g. an algoritm can replace a bookkeeper)
    - those that, thanks to technological advances, can be outsourced easily where the matching skill needed is cheaper (e.g., the internet making opening a chat based customer service center in an english speaking former British colony)
    - those that cannot (for now) be replaced or off-shored:
        - abstract tasks
        - manual tasks
        - care work
- takeaways: lots of "routinizable jobs" -- jobs with mostly routine tasks -- have been automated or offshored
    - this has led to a decrease in the demand for middle skill workers
    - more manual tasks are harder to replace with technology
    - over time occupations that are growing are on either end of the "skills/wages" spectrum

### To sum up
- skills biased technological change (the canonical model) reaises the productivity of some skill grpus more than others
- because most skills groups appear to be substitutes
- task-based displacement of workers is driving labor share declines in specific industries (1980-2016)
- there is nothing in the first model (canonical) that can explain why some jobs disappear.
- the tasks-based model and "task-based displacement" can explain automation-drive labor share declines

### do these theories explain what is described in the NYT piece well?
if they are missing something, what do you think they are missing? What kind of innovation is this article about?
- organizations matter
    - you can't give different benefits to different workers all under the same organization
- outsourced labor in competition with each other driving wages down
    - workers have little bargaining power
- increasing wages at the top drive cost-cutting measures in the middle, and outsourcing at the bottom.
- technology makes it easier to outsource, and the regulatory environment and corporate governance incentivizes outsourcing.

### David Weil: The fissured workplace
- instead of the old model of large corporations employing workers at all levels, increasingly jobs are outsourced by function outside the walls of the firm: firms buy specific services from other firms
Why is this happening?
- part of it is technology (uberization)
- part of it is changes i ownership structure of major corporations
