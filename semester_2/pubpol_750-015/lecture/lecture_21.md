### Next Thursday
- Do the readings!
- In class activity: data as labor

### Today
- Practice the skills from Assignment 2

### Assignment 2 Goals
- Explain (how do we know that hypothesis X is true/false considering the data?)
- Build on contradictory findings to come to a preliminary answer to an empirical question
- In the real world: Repeat but on a larger number of studies:
    - keep your eyes on the prize (most likely answer to a lead question considering the data), simply summarizing will not do.

Note:
- You are not a PhD student, you are an informed citizen trying to make an informed argument.

### What would you say in response to these statements?
- Inequality is due to the market forces, there is not much we can do about it!
- Demand for redistribution is lower than expected because people don't realize how bad inequality is.
- This country is not "one person, one vote" but "one dollar, one vote!"

Workflow:
- Identify the empirical claim you want to test / the question you are trying to answer.
- Write down your main answer in 1-3 sentences
- Now try to use this answer to organize 2-3 essay sections

When reading the papers:
- What do they find?
- How do they identify it?
- What am I not comfortable with?

### Example:
#### Demand for Redistribution is lower than expected, because people don't realize how bad inequality is.
- Question: Does giving people information about inequality affect their policy preferences?
- The twist: What kind of information are we talking about?
- What type of misinformation / misperception are we interested in?
    - They all think they are middle class (and feel they won't benefit from redistribution, or their envy is not as bad as it could be.) --> Cruces, et al.
    - They have a hard time imagining an alternative reality where growth would benefit them --> Kuziemko, et al.

### Potential Answer:
- Question: Does giving people information about inequality affect their policy preferences?
- The Answer: it depends on what you mean by information!!!
    1. Misperception of one's lower class status might explain lower support: when given correct information, support goes up.
    2. But more information about personal gains from more egalitarian growth has mixed and confusing effects.
- Bottom line: maybe the fat that people think they are all middle class does not help, but

### FB Version:
- Question: How does providing information customized to a survey respondent affect views on inequality and preferences for redistributive policies?
- Answer: Supplying information can affect opinions, but how much that changes attitudes depends on the type of information provided, and the groups you are surveying.
    - From this answer:
    - Section 1: How information changes opinions
    - Section 2: What kind of information matters
    - Section 3: Economic self-perception

### This Country is not "one person, one vote" but "one dollar, one vote!"
- It's hard to measure/document
- But it's probably true
- If we look in the right place at the right time, we can see it
- Why would businesses have spent this money otherwise?

### Race, Immigration, Redistribution
A recap.

- Does racialial fractionalization explain why there is less redistribution in the U.S.?
    - Smaller welfare state / less social spending
    - Larger hidden / often regressive welfare state
    - Less public goods with redistributive consequences (see last week)

- Given immigration-induced demographic change in Europe, is the welfare state in trouble?
    
### Mechanisms: How does immigration-induced diversity affect levels of social spending in practice?
- Surge in immigration in the 60s-70s, another pick up in the 90s
How does this matter?
- Direct channel:
    - voters perceive minority groups as over-represented among beneficiaries of welfare programs
    - altruisim is conditional on shared group membership
    - opposition to spending rooting in a distaste for helping members of out-groups can trump opposition to retrenchment rooted in a voter's position as a beneficiary of social transfers.

**==> support for spending cuts increases**

- Indirect channel:
    - it's not that you want less redistribution, but you might want less immigrants.
    - voters dislike outsiders, this dislike is latent, they engage with politics thinking about other issues
    - parties will "play the race card" and activate this latent dislike to their advantage
    - parties that play the "race card" are also more likely to be anti-redistribution

**==> support for parties that favor spending cuts increases, even if support for spending cuts does not increase**

### Evidence? (In Europe)
According to Direct Channel 1: Support for spending targeted to the unemployed increases as diversity increases.
- Soroka, et al. (2006): Social Spending on unemployment and Active Labor Market Policies decreases as diversity increases. BUT this could also imply spending decreases due to economic growth.
According to Direct Channel 2: Altruism is conditional on shared membership / perceived good faith effort.
- There is evidence that people are more likely to want to kick immigrants off the policy, NOT end the policy.

Indirect Channel: Far-right parties are more likely to be anti-redistribution.
- This used to be true, but no longer is.
- Far-right parties go from "market-liberal" to "popululist-socialist" (e.g. National Front in France)
- The nature of the far-right has changed in response to mass support for the welfare state.
==> This implies that support for parties that favor high spending for natives only increase as diversity increases, especially those who combine spending increases with anti-immigrant platforms.
- [There is not really evidence of this.]
