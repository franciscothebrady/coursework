Hall:
- Why did left parties leadership agree to policies that are not in the interest of redistribution?
-- because they thought it was the only solution to growth and employment

Solutions to slack-flation (70s)
- voter's don't have a choice

Question:
- What did public opinion look like?

Recap:
- neoliberal turn, part 1
    - debate between communism and social-democracy in the middle, and neo-liberalism on the right

- data on people's outlook on nationalization:
- context:
    - lots of social democracies after WWII ended up nationalizing larger utilities
- we have public opinion data before and after the nationalization
    - we can use that to see how public opinion shifted
- number of pro-privatization people increased between 1970, overtaking the number of pro-nationalization people in 1974
- this coincidence implies that thatcher might have been influencing pro-privatization opinion
- elite discourse matters

- part of this hinges on the fact that there are really only 2.5 parties in the UK
    - so the real ideological battle was within the conservative party, and how far thatcher was able to go with her policies

- impact of professionalization of political parties:
    - focus groups in the 1970s and 1980s in UK that gave rise to some of the third way politics of the post-thatcher labor party

- when it comes to redistributive policies:
    - some options are off the table
    - parties are puzzling through market and economic forces in order to achieve their goals
    - voters did not choose these specific policies

- cyclical nature of policy and opinion
    - elites can set agenda and decide on what policies to put into place
    - but they need to be paying attention to public opinion
    - but once those policies can be put in place, they can shape public opinion

### Why are some policies no longer part of the policy choice set?

- policymaking is locked in until the next paradigm shift
- context:
    - globalization financial/deregulation
    - over time the economy changes, jobs are lost and the economy changes
    - people don't always interpret these changes in political terms
    - why are left-wing politicians not trying to reshape public opinion towards policies of redistribution?


### Piketty
- conversative parties have become the party of higher income, lower education voters
- left parties have become parties of lower income, and high education voters

- elites of the party might be more accountable to new composition of the party:

### why did left parties leadership agree to policies that are not in the interest of redistribution?
- because it was seen as the "educated" way to the problem of low growth
- because a large share of their constituency would benefit / not be hurt by these policies
- people who "Control" the party are not the same people who are affected by the policies

### why are some policies no longer part of the policy choice set?
- because latent opposition among highly educated voters / leadership
- would hurt part of their electorate (easier to fight over other issues)
- compromise solution is more education, more childcare, more parental leave (not great for addressing inequality)


### the united states!
- evidence from ANES
    - shows increasing upward trend for top-quintile democrats in support for "agree government should help with living standards"
    - in bottom quintile democrats, trend is slightly negative
    - among republicans top quintile is constant, bottomw quintile is negative

- contrast to UK, high educated labor voters are much less supportive of redistributive policies

### Schecther (on Piketty)
- left has largely been complicit in the rise of inequality

### how does this change our assumptions:

assumption 0:
- the usa is a 2 party system

assumption 3:
- public policy has redistributive consequences

### assignment 2:
- option 1: other factors behind the neo-liberal turn
- option 2: role of money in US politics
- option 3 is about further probing voter preferences

### where are we at?
- part 1: why the great compression?
- part 2: why a return og income inequality since the 1980s
- part 3: why has there been no left turn in policy as a response?


### What's next?
part 4: why is it worse in the US?

facts:
- we know gini is worse in the us, and that it's been increasing over time
- france actually improved

for the top 1%, share of national income:
- US recovered much faster than other countries (top income share returned to pre-WWII levels)

Argument:
peter hall, "Varieties of Capitalism"
- capitalism comes in different flavors and america's flavor is:
    - prone to highe rlevels of income inequality, all else equal
    - very good at turning competitive pressures into higher levels of income inequality
        - vs. the version of capitalism in europe

### some problems faced by a capitalist entrepreneur:
- find funds to start a company
- find the right workers
    - train in-house and avoid poaching
    - poach from other firms without a labor cost escalation
- get workers to cooperate (work in the interest of the firm, not against it)

- turn uncertainty into calculable and insurable risk
    - keep labor costs (wages and benefits) under control
    - be able to control costs in a downturn (i.e., fire or decrease wages)
    - limit cash flow issues in the form of a sudden increase in borrowing costs
    - develop long term relationships with suppliers and clients

The way we should think about [Institutions] is as **solutions to problems**

### 2 big families of "solutions" to the labor problem
1. competitive market arrangement with "limited transaction costs"
2. collective bargaining and centralized wage setting with some job protection

> what are the implications of each for labor income inequality?
