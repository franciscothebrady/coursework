Paper: Matthew Smith, Danny Yagan, Owen Zidar, Eric Zwick, Capitalists in the Twenty-First Century, The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Volume 134, Issue 4, November 2019, Pages 1675â€“1745, https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjz020

### Research Question
Matthew Smith, Danny Yagan, Owen Zidar, and Eric Zwick compile novel linked tax and business income data and design several natural experiments to investigate the human capital contribution to income for top earners in the United States. The paper also explores how the income sources of the top 1% have changed over time, including the rise in categorizing business income as pass-through income. In the course of the paper, the authors also describe the composition of income sources for the top 1%, some demographic characteristics of top earners (age and "self-made" status), as well as the proportion of returns from labor versus financial and physical capital.

### Data
For national income, the authors use US data of stratified random samples of US income tax returns from 1962-2014, constructed by Piketty, Saez, and Zucman (2018), and then conduct comparison analysis with a more complete universe of de-identified data from personal US tax returns, restricted to the top 1% of earners. This personal income data used to construct a linked dataset with business income data for 11 million firms. The authors mention that there is a trade-off inherent in using either data set: using fiscal incomes from the tax data allows granular analysis, while the national income data sums to national income, allowing proportional analysis.

### Empirical Predictions
While the authors do not make any explicit empirical predictions, one of the motivations for the paper is an estimation assumption in Piketty, Saez, and Zucman, which sets 0% of S-corporation income as income from labor, and only 70% of the remaining income from pass-throughs as labor income. Based on this motivation, their implicit prediction is that this underestimates the share of labor income in S-corporation income.

### Empirical Tests
Zwick and compatriots show that the top 1% of income earners are primarily working-age owners of profitable firms in skill-intensive industries, who derive most of their income as human capital returns in the form of wages and pass-through profits. In order to test this claim empirically, the authors design a natural experiment exploiting owner death to measure the impact on business profits. They find that owner death leads to an 82% decline in firm profits, which they interpret as evidence that firm owners labor contributed profitable human capital to the firms. They conduct robustness checks using owner retirements, and find similar results. Considering upper and lower bounds, the authors settle on a 75% estimate for the share of labor income in the form of returns to human capital.


### Findings
#### Who earns top incomes and from what sources?
Using the top income data set, Zwick and company conclude that the main source of income for the top 1% is from labor income. Less than 20% of the top .1% derive the majority of their income from capital. When comparing source of income, they find that the majority earn pass-through income as the owners of businesses. The age distribution of these earners is similar to the age distribution of other workers, with the majority between the ages of 40 and 59.
#### How can we characterize the industry composition of these top earner-owned firms?
The authors find that the average top-earner owned firms are mid-market in size. Using NAICS codes, they find that the majority of the firms are in human-capital-intensive industries, such as professional or health services. These firms are also shown to be highly profitable, which the authors contend is consistent with the idea that profits are reflecting returns to human capital.
#### What do top earning pass-through owners contribute?
As described in the section above, Zwick et al. find that around 75% of top earners income is from returns to human capital.

### Ethical and Normative Assumptions
#### Compounding Returns to Firm Permanence:
Zwick, et al.'s natural experiments attempt to control for a number of factors, including firm size, owner-age, and other characteristics. However, they do not consider age of firms. Firm age and industry standing could mitigate the impact of owner death/retirement, affecting their estimates of the human capital returns. A useful extension could investigate the importance of firm age and industry standing on outcomes.
#### Bias and lifetime earnings gaps:
The authors use pass-through profits paid to firm owners as a measure of returns to human capital. This assumption does not contend with the impacts of bias in compensation for labor, or the impacts of discrimination on the returns to human capital. In addition, the returns to pass-throughs could also be implicitly measuring the impacts of networks and social position, ignoring the disparities in access to (financial) capital required to aquire pass-through ownership. While the authors consider It would be interesting to see if distributions of returns to human capital (as defined) are different across demographic groups.
#### Tax Treatment and Generalizability:
This paper is focused on the top 1% of earners in the United States. The composition of firm types, including pass-throughs and S-corporations, may be different in international contexts, as well as the consideration of different business tax treatments, which is noted as a future extension of the paper. This could affect estimates on human capital returns, and the generalizability of the findings. In addition, when discussing the tax incentives behind the conversion of C-Corporations to S-Corporations, the authors do not discuss the distributional effects of this change in the tax code.

### Implications
Zwick and the team explore the composition and sources of the top 1% incomes, but explicitly omit any analysis of the social value of the income distribution they describe. The authors do not make any explicit policy prescriptions in the paper, but suggest that because of the rate of pass-through income in the top 1%, and their findings on the tax incentives of converting C-Corporations to S-Corporations, there may be implications for tax policy. While the paper contributes new insights into the composition of top incomes, they do not address the implications of income concentration on political structures. The discussion on the Tax Reform Act of 1986, and the subsequent switching of C-Corporations to S-Corporations, could be expanded to consider the influence of the top earners at the time on the political process.
