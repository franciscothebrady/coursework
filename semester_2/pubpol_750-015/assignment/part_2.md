Please make sure the *introduction* addresses the following points: 
- what is the question investigated in these papers?
- why is this question important? Provide some context
- *very brief* overview of the papers, based on these papers *what is the most likely answer to this question?* [keep in mind that answering a question can mean reformulating it]
- most important point(s) one learns from these papers with regards to this question and how to answer it [can’t just be “its complicated”]
- Note that the latter two points are NOT summaries, they are your own take on the papers Think of this as a review essay [examples can be found here and here, don’t take these as templates though, but I hope they inspire you to go beyond mere summaries!]
- Additional information: These studies may not contradict each other, but speak to different aspects of the research questions. If this is the case, then you need to summarize the contributions in ways that go beyond a bullet point summary: what is the cumulative knowledge acquired by readings these studies? As always, some studies will be more convincing than others, so feel free to criticize (see the rubric). You should also highlight what you think is missing from these studies.

Graded on the following:
- All the points listed above are addressed in the intro (and developed in the paper), especially, a clear statement of the lead research question and an answer to this question.
- Good understanding of the studies, meet the "explanation" bar set in assignment 1
- Does not get bogged down into too many irrelevant details when discussing the design and empirics
- The substantive discussion of the two papers makes at least 3 important points, each bringing the studies in discussion with each other
- Amount of parroting left to a minimum
- Writing style


### Introduction
In social science, economics, and political psychology literature on redistribution and economic inequality, researchers frequently rely on survey evidence to understand how people perceive the distribution of income, as well as their preferences or demand for specific types of redistribution. Increased public perception of inequality may translate into support for redistributive policies, which in turn, following the median voter theory (Meltzer and Richard, 1981), may lead to changes in policy. However, framing effects and the introduction of additional information can significantly impact responses. In a 2023 paper, Støstad showed that differing descriptions of the same income distributions can alter respondents' perceptions and subsequent policy preferences. As such, it is important to further explore the impacts of both framing, perceptions, and supplemental information on survey responses. **Two papers address the question: How does providing information customized to a survey respondent affect views on inequality and preferences for redistributive policies?**
### The papers
In "Biased Perceptions of Income Distribution and Preferences for Redistribution: Evidence from a Survey Experiment", Cruces, Perez-Truglia, and Tetaz (CPTT), investigate how survey respondents perceive of their own place within the income distribution, and how those perceptions, after updating, affect demand for specific policies aimed at redistribution. The authors find that respondents systematically misperceive their own income position relative to the actual income distribution across the income spectrum. In their main result, among the participants in the treatment group who overestimated their relative position (thought they were richer), the researchers found slight positive impacts on their support for redistributive policies.

In their paper, "How Elastic Are Preferences for Redistribution? Evidence from Randomized Survey Experiments", Kuziemko, Norton, Saez, and Stantcheva (KNSS) use a barrage of online surveys combined with tailored information to measure effects on trust in government and support for specific tax and transfer policies. In their main survey, KMSS found that providing information tailored to the respondents on the income distribution as well as information on the historical economic impacts of higher income tax rates on the well off led to significant increases in agreement with questions on the severity of inequality, as well as increased support for policies of redistribution. Notably, the authors found a substantial increase in support for estate taxes, which they explore further in a follow-up survey and design.

### The most likely answer
Both papers use randomized survey experiments to measure perceptions of income distribution, with the treated sample being exposed to tailored information on inequality, with the expectation that participants would update their beliefs. Taken together, these papers suggest that providing additional contextual information can, in some cases, change participants perceptions of inequality and subsequent support for redistributive public policies. However, while perceptions and opinions on inequality may be impacted, this effect does not always translate into support for redistributive policies.

### Most important points from each paper
#### Cruces
In Cruces, et al., the researchers conduct a randomized survey experiment in the Greater Buenos Aires area, Argentina. The randomly selected treatment consists of asking participants to estimate their position, in deciles, on the income distribution, and then providing them with information on their actual position. The rest of the survey is then conducted as normal. The results showed that among participants, over 50% had a negative bias in estimating their position on the income decile distribution, or thought they were less rich relative to the rest of the population, while only 30% overestimated their position (positive bias). The authors hypothesize that those who estimated their position more accurately had been exposed to a greater variety of incomes, forming a larger "reference group" for perceptions on income. In order to test this, they utilize a question in the survey asking about whether the participant had friends or coworkers from all social classes. They find that combined with information about the income ranking of their local area, this question had a significant association with participants perception of their own income, implying that the reference group is important in forming perceptions of income.
Turning to the results on policy preferences the authors divide their results into four groups: those who underestimated their position (thought they were poorer than in reality), those who estimated their position correctly, those who overestimated their position (thought they were richer than average), and those who overestimated their position by more than one decile. Among those who correctly estimated their position (no bias), support for redistributive policies was not significantly different from the control group. However, among those who overestimated their position (positive bias), the authors found a relatively large and statistically significant difference between the treatment and control group across support for redistributive policies, measured both by responses to questions related to how the government should support the poor, both as mean aggregate supports, and across the individual questions. For those with the largest information gaps, those who overestimated their position by more than one decile, the authors found a larger increase in support for redistributive policies. The authors conclude that the results suggest that the perceived position of an individual in the income distribution is an important determinant of their support for redistributive policies.

#### Kuizemko
In Kuziemko, et al., the researchers conduct multiple randomized survey experiments using the Amazon Mechanical Turk (mTurk) platform to explore the impact of information treatments on perceptions of inequality and support for government and non-government inequality policies.

### Critique
#### Survey Populations
In their paper, Cruces, et al. use a sample of 1,060 individuals in the Greater Buenos Aires area. In their description of the summary statistics of the sample, the authors acknowledge that due to the higher average income levels in Buenos Aires relative to the rest of the country, the survey sample does not reflect the average income distribution of Argentina. Given the results, it's possible that the responses of this sample may only extrapolate to impacts of the information treatment on an metropolitan urban population, rather than the country as a whole.
In the mTurk sample, Kuziemko, et al. survey a much larger sample over multiple rounds of surveys, totaling 10,000 participants. However, the authors also acknowledge that the mTurk sample is not representative of the US population, pointing instead to a similar lack of representativeness in other standard poll samples, specifically a CBS election 2009 poll and the American Life Panel, a more representative survey conducted by RAND. The authors justify this by appealing to the cost-effectiveness of the mTurk platform, and the ability to conduct multiple rounds of surveys. While they are able to control for demographics in their estimations, it's not clear whether this is enough to overcome the limitations of the sample, especially given the focus on inequality, trust in government, and redistributice policies. In a 2016 analysis of mTurk workers, Pew found that the majority of mTurk workers earn less than $5 per hour, and that 89% of the tasks involved surveys. In another exploration of mTurk workers, Hara, et al. (2018) found that the average wage of mTurk workers in their sample was $2 per hour. Given the low wages of mTurk workers, and other demographic differences, it's possible that the socio-economic situations of the respondents played heavily into their perceptions of both their own economic position and their attitudes on government and redistributive policies. The additional exploration of attitudes towards government workers allowed Kuizemko, et al. to create an effective priming mechanism for the trust in government questions, but given the limitations and potential biases of the mTurk sample, it may only be illustrative of perceptions of inequality and redistributive policies among a select group of online survey workers.
