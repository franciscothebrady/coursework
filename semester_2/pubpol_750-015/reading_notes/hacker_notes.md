## Reading Notes

"The American Political Economy: A Framework and Agenda for Research."
Hacker, Hertel-Fernandez, Pierson, Thelen

### American Political Economy (APE)
- Emerging framework
- Draws on comparative political economy (CPE)
- America's federal structure of governance and territorially based elections make spatial geography a key factor in shaping policy outcomes.
    - "Who gets what, when, how, and **where**"
- Three most important features:
    1. Tudor Polity: divided power, outsized role of courts, emphasis on local self-rule.
        - "... hinders the broad provision of public goods and deeply affects the distribution of advantage and disadvantage within the American political economy."
    2. Long-term conflicts: American institutions work best for organized political actors able to coordinate across multiple venues over long periods of time.
        - Strategies of evatsion and exit from regulatory constraint are often successful.
        - Voter influence in highly mediated and conditional.
        - Importance of "issue bundling" within the two-party system.
    3. History of racial oppression and division: structures of policy and social organization reinforce racial inequalities, effect voter attitudes and policy preferences. Even affects the basic structure of the economy.
- Investigate 3 key questions in the chapter:
    1. Why has the organized business community in the United States simultaneously narrowed its goals and increased its power over the past generation?
    2. Why has the mainstream conservative party in the United States – to a degree unrivaled within the world of advanced democracies – embraced a program of ethno-nationalist politics, antidemocratic measures, inegalitarian priorities, and state dismantling?
    3. Why does America’s early lead in the development of a postindustrial knowledge economy based on urban density and digital technology appear to be increasingly threatened?

### Why a Field of APE?
- Political Economy -- How economic and political systems are linked
- Political interventions influence shape of economy
- Economic outcomes then influence shape of politics
#### Insights from Other Comparative Fields
- IPE: American political economy is important because of role in global economy.
- CPE: National "flavors" of capitalist democracies exhibit large variation
- Politics is a central source of these differences
- CPE: Key question is not whether governments become involved in the economy, but the **form** of that involvement.
- Insight: Patterns of governance generate distinct outcomes over long periods of time, as such it is important to study the role of organized actors with strong incentives to shape political and market instutions.

### Foundations of APE Approach

APE is focused on: which **institutional configurations** shape **coalitional politics** to produce long-term **developmental processes.**

#### Institutional Configurations
- political economies consist of a set of institutions that shape the distribution of resources and power.

#### Coalitional Politics
- building and transforming large-scale policies requires sustained efforts by well-resourced and highly organized actors, acting in concert with other institutional actors, especially political parties.

#### Developmental Processes
- policy regimes are formed through multiple rounds of contestation across multiple sites of political activity

> Intitutional configurations shape coalitional dynamics, and in turn are shaped by them.

#### Insights:
- economic and political power may be most consequential where it is **least** visible.
- powerful actors and coalitions often seek to organize governance in ways that remove important issues from direct political contestation.

### Why political economy is ignored in american politics research
- often study institutions in isolation
- focus on individual actors and their motivations (where the "action" is: elections)
- less focus on other features of the american political economy, past the "electoral connection"

### Benefits to comparative political economy
- Focus on coordinated market economies (CMEs) in europe.
- inspired by varieties of capitalism (hall)
- united states is a liberal market economy (LME), used only to contrast with CMEs.

#### United States as LME
- it is a stark outlier among LMEs, for three important reasons:
1. fragmented and territorialized state: uniquely fragmented political system
2. fragmented economic organizations: both employer associations and labor unions have limited capacity to solve problems. other LMEs share some of these characterisitcs, **the US is an outlier in all of them.**
3. deep racial cleavages: racial divisions are constitutive of the american political economy. Coupled with federalism, racial divisions play a key role in shaping the spatial development of the APE.

### Toward a field of american political economy

#### An exceptionally fragmented institutional landscape
