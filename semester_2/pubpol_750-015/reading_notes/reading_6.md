Sands, M.L., de Kadt, D. Local exposure to inequality raises support of people of low wealth for taxing the wealthy. Nature 586, 257–261 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2763-1

Summary:
- Series of experiments to test exposure to inequality and support policies to redistribute wealth

Experiment: The participants were exposed to a high status car (BMW) and asked to sign a petition supporting redistributive policies. In the presence of the high status car, participants were more likely to sign the petition. This test was compared to a signing outcomes when asked to sign a petition about nuclear energy. Participants asked to sign the nuclear energy petition did not show any change in signing behavior when exposed to treatment.

Thoughts:
- unclear how effective exposure to high status car will be in reminding people of inequality
- the use of the placebo test was a good control to show that the treatment was effective conditional on the topic of the petition.
- interesting results becuase south africa is a highly unequal society.
