### Empire of Law
#### Inequality
- Inequality is at it's highest levels since the French Revolution
- Many theories explaining why:
    - Marxists: Exploitation of labor
    - Anti-globalization: Globalization has limited state power to progressively tax.
    - Piketty: Capital growth in mature economies

- Question: How is wealth created in the first place?
    - Why does capital often survive economic cycles and shocks?
    - How is capital protected and grown over time.

#### What happened?
- Pistor's Answer: Capital is protected over time by the legal code.
- Capital: Asset + Law
    - Assets change over time: land, firms, debt, human know-how, **code**, **data**
    - Capital is composed of an asset and legal code, which is what allows it to accumulate and grow legally.
- Modules: Legal Devices from which capital is legally encoded.
    - contract law, property rights, collateral law, trust, corporate law, bankruptcy law, etc.
    - determine:
        - priority of claims on assets
        - durability of claims
        - universality
        - convertibility
    - **once encoded, capital can be used to generate wealth.**
fb notes:
- i'm not sure I fully understand the convertibility module.
- this also sounds very similar to marx's definition of fictitious capital (capital that is not directly tied to the production of goods and services, more about the ownership of assets and claims on future production)

#### Why does this matter?
- The process by which assets are converted into capital matters, because it is how those who accumulate wealth are able to protect it with the coercive power of the state.
- the legal underpinnings of wealth accumulation is not well explored.
- piketty described the consistency of the rate of return on capital, but did not explain why.
    - piketty shows that rural land was the most important source of wealth until the early 20th century.
    - shares, bonds, and other financial assets have since replaced it.

#### Law's Guiding Hand
- Adam Smith said capital was more likely used in the country of origin, but legal changes have allowed it to be used anywhere.
- this offers capital holders a choice of where to park their assets in the place that will allow them to maximize advantage (returns, legal protection, etc.)
- most states recognize foreign law for property rights, financial collateral, corporations, etc
- this has contributed to the skewed distribution of wealth

#### implications of the empire of law
- empire of law: structure of primarily domestic law that made it easier for asset holders to move their assets across borders.
- has implications for political economy of capitalism: shifts from class identity and struggle to a question of who has access to and control over the legal code.

#### legal systems of global capital:
- english common law
- laws of new york state
- consequence: **"effective legal protection almost anywhere allows private self-interest to flourish without the need to return home to benefit from local institutions."**

### The enigma of capital
- the term capital was used before marx, who explained that money and capital are not the same.
- to marx: "capital is produced in a process that includes the exchange of goods for money and the extraction of surplus from labor."
- outward appearance of capital has changed dramatically over time
- pistor: "capital is not a thing; neither can it be pinned down to a specific period of time, a political regime, or just one set of antagonsitic social relations as between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie."
- many of the legal institutions that we use today to code capital were first invented in the time of feudalism.
- marx: objects undergo a transformation before they can be exchanged for money.
- polanyi: only items produced for exchange are commodities, none of the assets are
- pistor: commodification is man-made but legal coding is key. capitalism is the market economy in which *some* assets are placed on legal steroids.
    - with some creativity, human labor can be transformed into capital (e.g. intellectual property rights)
    - historically, slaves were used as collateral to secure loans, illustrating the power of legal code in the making of capital.

#### Definitions of capital
- Veblen: an assets income-yielding capacity
- John Commons: the present value of expected beneficial behavior of other people
    - law is prominent in this definition, as enhancing the reliability of others expected behavior.
- Jonathan Levy: a legal entity that is assigned a value in expectation of a likely future pecuniary income.

Conclusion: capital is a legal quality that helps create and shape wealth.

### Capital's legal attributes
- code: term for the process by which certain legal institutions have been combined to refactored to code capital.
- the most important: contracts, property, collateral, the law of trusts and corporations, and bankruptcy law.

#### Modules
- Priority: legal codification of ranking of claims on assets.
    - Collateral law works in a similar way.
- Durability: extends priority claims over time.
    - the corporation is an example of how legal claims to assets can be shielded, even in bankruptcy, over time from both creditors and shareholders.
- Universality: the ability to extend claims across borders.
    - contract agreements bind two parties, but it takes state power to extend priority and durability rights across the world.
- Convertibility: the ability to transform one asset into another.
    - gives asset owners an implicit or explicit guarantee to convert their assets into state money when they can no longer find private takers.
    - presumes the right to freely transfer an asset.
