Does housing capital contribute to inequality? A comment on Thomas Pikettyâ€™s Capital in the 21st Century

- Bonnet et al note that Piketty takes housing capital into account in his calculations of capital.
- Calculating the returns to housing capital is complicated. Housing is *Both* a consumption good and an investment good.
    - returns to housing as a landlord is rental income
    - owners-occupiers do not receive rental income, **but savings on rent are an implicit return.**
    (Ask about implicit rents in class)
- Recalculating the capital stock using a measure of housing capital based on rent indices, "the rise in the capital/income ratio is modest" **and in the long run they observe a decline.**

#### Housing Capital and Inequality
- the authors use their preferred method to recalculate the capital/income ratio for:
    - France: the rise in the capital/income ratio is modest
    - Germany: has lower rates of ownership, but the capital/income ratio rose over the time period.
    - US: capital/income ratio was stable

#### Capital/Income Ratio ignores distribution of capital in the population
- housing prices are disconnected from the share of income from housing
- decomposing share of capital income in total income:
    - housing capital is a product of the value of rents over housing prices, times the housing price and quantity of housing divided by total income.
    - in this equation, prices cancel out, implying that a rise in hosuing prices has no impact on the share of capital income in total income.

#### Implications for inequality
- housing price has no impact on short term consumption
    - homeowners only save rent relative to tenants, regardless of housing prices
    (ask about this)
- interest rates allow shifting consumption to the first years of the loan

- impacts of housing prices are limited, because only sellers would increase consumption
- housing price increases are uses as insurance against risk for owners (other paper)

##### Distrubution of housing capital
- when there are more owners housing capital is more equally distributed
- income from housing capital is less likely to increase inequality than it was historically because the spread in ownership has more evenly spread housing capital
(ask about this: implies that opportunity for home ownership is more available than it seems, even in france)
    - there is less construction and more housing transactions, this implies a velocity argument: https://economic-research.bnpparibas.com/html/en-US/Housing-supply-challenges-France-unsolvable-issue-12/19/2023,49172

#### Conclusion
- housing capital is not a major contributor to inequality
- the rise in the capital/income ratio is modest
- the distribution of housing capital is more equal than it was historically
- using a different measure based on rent indices produces a different picture than piketty

### FB Thoughts:
1. I don't buy it. This ignores financialization and borrowing against housing as a source of income and consumption.
2. Housing price increases interacts with stagnating wages creating a barrier to entry to home ownership.

Wealth Taxation: Lessons from History and Recent Developments. Emannuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman

- european wealth taxes had a narrow base, large exemptions, avoidance, and evasion

- main finding: european welath tax collected little revenue relative ot a simple 1 percent marginal tax on the top 1 percent.

- design of a successful wealth tax:
    - focus on the ultrawealthy
    - comprehensive reporting and prefilled returns will maximize compliance
        - compliance is high when income is reported by a third party
    - allow tax payers to pay in kind, such as shares.

### FB Thoughts:
1. Love it but political feasibility is low.
2. In conjunction with other programs might make this more palatable. UBI and decreases in other social spending.
3. In the US, majority of tax evasion comes from Schedule C business income underrepos
