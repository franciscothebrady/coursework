Feldstein M. Reducing Poverty, Not Inequality. The Public Interest. 1999;137 (Fall):33-41. 

### Notes:

#### Policy should address poverty, not inequality

- Pareto-principle: Policy change is pareto-efficient if it makes at least one person better off without making anyone else worse off.
- Policies that benefit high-income people but do not harm or lower incomes of low-income people can be considered pareto-efficient.
- "Spiteful Egalitarians" - people who "see inequality as so intolerable that they refard increasing the income of the wealthy as a "bad thing," even if that increased income does not come at anyone else's expense." (p. 34)
    - Feldstein argues that the spiteful egalitarians assign a negative social value to the increased income of the wealthy. (Net bad)
- Gini Coefficient: Measure of the concentration of income in a society. 0 = perfect equality, 1 = perfect inequality.
    - Feldstein argues that those who regard an increasing Gini coefficient as a bad thing are committing a similar error (assigning a negative social value to the increased income of the wealthy).

#### The rich get richer
- Four factors that have contributed to higher incomes for the wealthy:
    1. Increase in the number of people with advanced education and enhanced marketable skills
    2. Increase in entrepreneurial activity
    3. High-wage individuals work increasingly longer hours.
    4. Declines in the cost of capital in a low inflation environment.
- These four things are good in themselves as they add to the wealth of those individuals.

#### Mismeasuring Poverty
- The real issue is poverty, not inequality.
- Three possible sources of poverty:
    1. Unemployment
    2. Lack of earnings ability
    3. Individual choice
- Poverty is difficult to measure and is overstated because it does not take into account in-kind benefits, like housing and health care.
- Real incomes are also distorted by underground economies.
    - People do not report their true income because it would reduce eligibility for cash and in-kind transfers.

- Unemployment: There is some amount of long-term unemployment in the United States
    - It is understated because eventually people are classified as not in the labor force.
    - This is distinct from unemplotment during the Great Depression
    - It is also distinct from cyclical unemployment, which is usually less than 10 weeks.
    - In Europe, cyclical unemployment becomes long term unemployment because of the generous unemployment benefits.
    - In the US, reform in the 1980s made unemployment benefits subject to personal income tax.

- Lack of earnings ability: Most commonly recognized reason for poverty is the failure of people to earn more than a very low wage.
- One factor is lower rates of educational attaintment and low quality schools
    - One way to improve this is to increase the amount of compentition among school districts and educational choices (religious schools).
- Another factor is inadequate training
    - The minimum wage restricts the ability of workers to obtain on-the-job training, because it is too expensive to hire an unskilled worker at the legal minimum wage.
    - government-sponsored training programs have proven to be ineffective and expensive.
- Low cognitive ability (lol holy shit this fucking guy) due to IQ or dysfunctional lifestyles (drug abuse, alcoholism).

#### The role of individual choice
- Some poverty can be traced to individual choices.
- Some people may conclude (wrongly) that they are better off not working and instead accepting government benefits.
- "Reducing such voluntary poverty requires reexamiing the structure of welfare programs"

Fraser Nancy. 1995. "From Redistribution to Recognition? Dilemmas of Justice in a 'Postsocialist' Age." New Left Review. 1/212

### developing a new critical theory of recognition
- synthesize versions of the cultural politics of difference ("identity") and the social politics of equality
- justice requires *both* redistribution and recognition
- **under what conditions can a politics of recognition help support a politics of resdistribution?**

### redistribution-recognition issue
- social movements are centered on axes of difference.
- two understandings of injustice:
    - socioeconomic injustice: exploitation, economic marginalization, depirvation.
    - cultural or symbolic injustice: cultural domination, nonrecognition, disrespect.
    fb note: this is erasure
- in practice these two types of injustice are intertwined.
- two distinct remedies for injustice:
    - for socioeconomic: political restructuring and redistribution
    - for cultural: cultural or symbolic change (recognition)
### bivalent collectivies
- consider two extreme examples:
- a collectivity that owes its entire social heirarchy to capitalist economic structure
    - in this case, any injustices suffered are "injuries of class"
    - the remedy is "to abolish itself as a class", altering the class distribution of social burdens and benefits. (redistribution)
- on the other end: a collectivity that owes its entire social heirarchy and organization to cultural-valuational structure.
    - the root is this injustive would be cultural misrecognition, any economic injustices would derive from the cultural organization.
    - the remedy in this case is to this injustice would be cultural recognition, as opposed to any economic/class based redistribution.
    - example: a despised sexuality
        - sexuality is a mode of social differentiation, but is distributed across all classes.
        - injustices suffered by a despised sexuality are strictly of recognition
        - cultural devaluation, shaming, harassment, discrimination, and denial of legal rights.
        - the remedy is recognition, not redistribution.
- the cases at the extremes are legible, but things become murkier when considering collectivities closer to the middle of the conceptual spectrum. 
(fb note: intersectionality)
    - these collectivities are "bivalent" -- distinct as collectivities by virtue of both cultural and socioeconomic characteristics.
    - when in a disadvantaged position in society, they are subject to both cultural and socioeconomic injustices.
    - this could include both cultural misrecognition *and* economic maldistribution.
    - in this case, the remedies would need to include some combination of both redistribution and recognition.
    - the paradigmatic examples of this type of collectivity is gender and "race".
- gender
    - a basic structuring principle of a political economy
    - structures division between paid "productive" labor, and unpaid reproductive and domestic labor
    - also structures division within paid labor -- male-dominated higher paying labor and lower-paid "pink-collar" and domestic-service occupations
    - gender is also subject to exclusion, marginalization, and devaluation in the cultural sphere, as well as denial of full legal rights.
    - androcentric norms devalue and stigmatize femininity
    - in this way it is similar to the despised sexuality
    - the remedy is then to accord positive recognition to the devalued group
    - gender is a bicalent mode of collectivity: contains a political-economic dimension that requires redistribution to attain justice, but also a cultural-valuational aspect that also demands recognition and respect.
    - "redressing gender injustice requires change in both political-economy and culture"
- race
    - similar structuring of political-economic aspects: division of labor, maldistribution of income and wealth
    - similar cultural-valuational aspects: racism, privileging traits associated with whiteness, devaluation of traits associated with blackness.
### affirmation or transformation
- two types of redress
    - affirmation: the recognition and revaluation of an existing identity
        - tends to promote existing group differentiations
    - transformation: the transformation of an existing identity and the existing structures that create it
        - aims to destabilize group differentiations
