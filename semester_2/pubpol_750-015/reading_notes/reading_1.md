Feldstein M. Reducing Poverty, Not Inequality. The Public Interest. 1999;137 (Fall):33-41. 

### Notes:

#### Policy should address poverty, not inequality

- Pareto-principle: Policy change is pareto-efficient if it makes at least one person better off without making anyone else worse off.
- Policies that benefit high-income people but do not harm or lower incomes of low-income people can be considered pareto-efficient.
- "Spiteful Egalitarians" - people who "see inequality as so intolerable that they refard increasing the income of the wealthy as a "bad thing," even if that increased income does not come at anyone else's expense." (p. 34)
    - Feldstein argues that the spiteful egalitarians assign a negative social value to the increased income of the wealthy. (Net bad)
- Gini Coefficient: Measure of the concentration of income in a society. 0 = perfect equality, 1 = perfect inequality.
    - Feldstein argues that those who regard an increasing Gini coefficient as a bad thing are committing a similar error (assigning a negative social value to the increased income of the wealthy).

#### The rich get richer 
- Four factors that have contributed to higher incomes for the wealthy:
    1. Increase in the number of people with advanced education and enhanced marketable skills
    2. Increase in entrepreneurial activity
    3. High-wage individuals work increasingly longer hours.
    4. Declines in the cost of capital in a low inflation environment.
- These four things are good in themselves as they add to the wealth of those individuals.

#### Mismeasuring Poverty
- The real issue is poverty, not inequality.
- Three possible sources of poverty: 
    1. Unemployment
    2. Lack of earnings ability
    3. Individual choice
- Poverty is difficult to measure and is overstated because it does not take into account in-kind benefits, like housing and health care.
- Real incomes are also distorted by underground economies.
    - People do not report their true income because it would reduce eligibility for cash and in-kind transfers.

- Unemployment: There is some amount of long-term unemployment in the United States
    - It is understated because eventually people are classified as not in the labor force.
    - This is distinct from unemplotment during the Great Depression
    - It is also distinct from cyclical unemployment, which is usually less than 10 weeks.
    - In Europe, cyclical unemployment becomes long term unemployment because of the generous unemployment benefits.
    - In the US, reform in the 1980s made unemployment benefits subject to personal income tax.

- Lack of earnings ability: Most commonly recognized reason for poverty is the failure of people to earn more than a very low wage.
- One factor is lower rates of educational attaintment and low quality schools
    - One way to improve this is to increase the amount of compentition among school districts and educational choices (religious schools).
- Another factor is inadequate training
    - The minimum wage restricts the ability of workers to obtain on-the-job training, because it is too expensive to hire an unskilled worker at the legal minimum wage.
    - government-sponsored training programs have proven to be ineffective and expensive.
- Low cognitive ability (lol holy shit this fucking guy) due to IQ or dysfunctional lifestyles (drug abuse, alcoholism).

#### The role of individual choice
- Some poverty can be traced to individual choices.
- Some people may conclude (wrongly) that they are better off not working and instead accepting government benefits.
- "Reducing such voluntary poverty requires reexamiing the structure of welfare programs"
