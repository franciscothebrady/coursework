When you come to class, please be ready to engage with the following claims: 

Claim 1: "European countries are less unequal than the U.S. because their population is white and homogenous"  

Claim 2: "Racism explains why the U.S. welfare state is so bad at income redistribution" 

=> look for anything in the readings that speaks to these claims, take notes, bring these notes to class, you will have to share them with your peers in a group setting. 

## Reading 1:
Alesina, Alberto, Edward Glaeser. "Fighting Poverty in the US and Europe: A World of Difference. Chapter 6: Race and Redistribution". Oxford University Press, 2004.

### Question: Why is there a gap in welfare spending between the U.S. and Europe?

Context: Glaeser and Alesina argue that ~50% can be explained by differences in political institutions.

Argument: The bulk of the unexplained gap is due to the U.S. being more racially diverse than Europe.
Nuanced view: Racial hatred is not caused by any external factors, but manufactured by politicians looking to gain political support.

Evidence:
- Welfare payments are lower in U.S. states with larger minority populations.
- International evidence:
    - Europe: Over 90% of residents are ethnically european
    - USA: 75% of residents are white, 12% black, 12% hispanic
        - States have even greater minority population distribution

Measures:
- Fractionalization Index: measures the probability that two randomly selected individuals are from different racial groups.
    - US has largest racial fractionality index, Austria has lowest

Test:
- Measure whether countries with greater ethnic division have lower levels of redistribution (as a share of GDP)

Results: 
- Across all countries the relationship holds -- countries with lower fractionalization have higher levels of redistribution. Overall correlation is .66.
- Across only rich countries: Relationship is weaker but still significant. (R^2 = 0.63)
- Langauge fractionalization is less strong but still correlated.

### What about welfare spending across states? 

Question: Does racial hetergeneity explain differences in welfare spending across U.S. states?
Hypothesis: States with higher % of Black population will have lower AFDC benefits.
Results: States with higher % of Black population have lower AFDC benefits.
    - Highest: California
    - Lowest: Mississippi
    - Correlation: 0.49
    - after controlling for income: R^2 = 0.67

#### Survey Evidence:
- Attitudes about race strongly predict support for welfare spending.

Test: Exposure to welfare recipients of different races (Luttmer 2001)
Results: Proximity to welfare recipients of the same race increases level of support for redistribution.
Conclusion: Race is an important factor in determining individual preferences for redistribution.

### Historical Examples:
- Use of racial division to beat the advance of populist parties in the American South
- Contrast: Populist parties enjoyed support for much longer in midwest and western states
- progressive politics had redistributive aims but exploited racial politics to gain support
- Civil rights Era
- Contrast to Europe: rise of socialist parties
    - anti-immigrant sentiment

### Conclusion
- "If racial differences do not necessarily lead to hatred, then why are these differences so strongly correlated with lower levels of redistribution? **Our view is that these groups create the potential for hatred. Following Glaeser (2002), we suggest that hatred is the outcome of a political equilibrium where politicians supply hate when hatred is a complement to their policies.**" (p. 179)


## Reading 2:
Cavaille, Charlotte, and Karine Van der Straeten. "Immigration and Support for Redistribution: Lessons from Europe." Journal of Economic Literature. 2023.

### Question
- Is the difference in welfare spending between the U.S. and Europe due to racial divides?

Context: Scholars argue that the U.S. has a lower level of welfare spending than Europe because of racial divides and political incentives. Cavaille and Van der Straeten argue existing research is inconsistent with the assumption that people have a negative preference for sharing across racial groups, and that comparison to the United States is not useful because of institutional and historical differences.

Evidence: ESS shows absence of a correlation between anti-immigrant sentiment and support for income redistribution.

Hypothesis: If Americanization is happening, should expect to see a decline in mass support for redistributive policies in Europe.
