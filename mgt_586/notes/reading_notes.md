### Schwartz &mdash; Learning from Lawsuits  

In this reading, Schwartz details the information collected in the course of lawsuits against the police department for Section 1983 cases, which are related to violations of constitutional rights. They found that in many cases, when police departments are sued for section 1983 violations, they often settle the cases, and upon settling, the departments often do not make changes in response to the issues highlighted by the litigation, despite their cost and impact on city budgets.  

1.  Schwartz notes that the litigation in some cases is a crucial tool to shed light on the specific circumstances of specific violations, and can shed light on practices and policies that the departments can learn and act on, but that individual departments frequently ignore or do not follow up to address the root causes of the lawsuits&mdash;the highest offending police officers.  

2.  Complaint processing can reveal organizational inertia and oppositional attitudes to process improvement within departments. Schwartz noted cases where officers discouraged or harrassed people who came in to file complaints, or misfiled them so the complaints would not be investigated correctly.  
3.  Complaints and lawsuits can sometimes be useful in identifying lapses in training.  Schwartz describes the Portland police department finding a pattern of complaints that indicated officers did not fully understand restrictions on entering homes without warrants. When the department created additional training materials on this subject, the complaints decreased.  
4.  Complaints and lawsuits will not identify all issues, and are likely to miss larger issues havingt to do with organizational attitudes towards oversight. When complaints are difficult to file in the first place, that reduces the amount of useful information that can be gathered from them.  
5.  Complaints and lawsuits may sometimes provide a misleading picture of misconduct. During investigation, complainants may overstate their injuries or harm, while police officers may understate their actions. Some complaints may never be filed because of the administrative and legal burden they bring.

Questions: 
What are some of the main barriers to hiring a more diverse police workforce that is committed to and capable of carrying out a meaningful agenda for police reform? How do prevailing hiring practices need to change to help build a strong workforce with the skills and values that police officers ought to have?

1.  Under what conditions is an increase in workplace diversity likely to affect front-line policing for the better, and under what conditions is it likely to have little impact (or even a negative impact)?  
I think increasing front-line diversity would likely have the most impact on what Sklansky calls community effects, as well as organizational effects. Community effects are the impacts that a more diverse police force would have on interactions with the community they serve. Five Thirty Eight reported that among the 75 cities with the largest police departments in the US, on average 60% of the police officers lived outside of the city limits. Diversity in hiring also means being more intentional about hiring police who are from the communities they serve. In many cases this would also impact diversity of the front-line staffing.  

2.  What are the most important counter-forces that may hinder the impact of demographic change in the police workforce on front-line police work?  
Sklansky also mentions this in his article-- the idea that a woman or minority police officer may lose some credibility with their non-police community by joining the police force. This perception could undermine the desired impact of diversifying hiring.  

3.  What, if anything, can police managers and outside stakeholders do to combat them?  
Management buy-in on the positive impacts of increasing diversity in the front-line staffing is one of the most important ways to instill lasting organizational change. The PERF report highlighted success in Fairfax, Virgina, which revamped recruiting efforts as a "holistic approach" to hiring, involving the entire department and multiple different outreach strategies.  

4.  How do the specific features of police organizations, police work, and police history mediate the impact of workplace diversity in the policing context?  
The historical context of police interactions with communities of color is in tension with the idea of increasing diversity in the police force. The PERF report mentions overcoming negative perceptions of policing when recruiting at HBCUs, noting that students have personal experience in their families of police violence or over-policing in their communities. It will take more than more police officers of color to overcome more than a century of horror stories involving police. 


5.  How might your answers to the questions I posed in the previous bullet points differ for other kinds of public sector organizations?  

Increasing diversity in professional organizations absolutely has to be an active endeavor. It requires near constant reinforcement, or else hiring practices return to informal networks. People get jobs, or referrals to jobs, or examples of success in jobs, from people they know, or friends of their friends, etc. These informal networks, just because of the structure and history of American society, tend to be relatively segregated, perpetuating networks of exclusion.  

Notes: 
"Women are seriously underrepresented in policing, making up only around 13 percent of full-time sworn officers in local police agencies and 7 percent of sworn state troopers."
"Agencies should create or expand family-friendly policies and resources that support women (and men) in balancing the demands of the job and the needs of their families"
