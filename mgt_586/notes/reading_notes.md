### Schwartz &mdash; Learning from Lawsuits  

In this reading, Schwartz details the information collected in the course of lawsuits against the police department for Section 1983 cases, which are related to violations of constitutional rights. They found that in many cases, when police departments are sued for section 1983 violations, they often settle the cases, and upon settling, the departments often do not make changes in response to the issues highlighted by the litigation, despite their cost and impact on city budgets.  

1.  Schwartz notes that the litigation in some cases is a crucial tool to shed light on the specific circumstances of specific violations, and can shed light on practices and policies that the departments can learn and act on, but that individual departments frequently ignore or do not follow up to address the root causes of the lawsuits&mdash;the highest offending police officers.  

2.  Complaint processing can reveal organizational inertia and oppositional attitudes to process improvement within departments. Schwartz noted cases where officers discouraged or harrassed people who came in to file complaints, or misfiled them so the complaints would not be investigated correctly.  
3.  Complaints and lawsuits can sometimes be useful in identifying lapses in training.  Schwartz describes the Portland police department finding a pattern of complaints that indicated officers did not fully understand restrictions on entering homes without warrants. When the department created additional training materials on this subject, the complaints decreased.  
4.  Complaints and lawsuits will not identify all issues, and are likely to miss larger issues havingt to do with organizational attitudes towards oversight. When complaints are difficult to file in the first place, that reduces the amount of useful information that can be gathered from them.  
5.  Complaints and lawsuits may sometimes provide a misleading picture of misconduct. During investigation, complainants may overstate their injuries or harm, while police officers may understate their actions. Some complaints may never be filed because of the administrative and legal burden they bring.  

###  Reading Notes: 

Main reading: Police Executive Research Forum (PERF)
Second reading: James Forman, Jr. -- Locking Up Our Own

Questions: 
What are some of the main barriers to hiring a more diverse police workforce that is committed to and capable of carrying out a meaningful agenda for police reform? How do prevailing hiring practices need to change to help build a strong workforce with the skills and values that police officers ought to have?

1.  Under what conditions is an increase in workplace diversity likely to affect front-line policing for the better, and under what conditions is it likely to have little impact (or even a negative impact)?  
I think increasing front-line diversity would likely have the most impact on what Sklansky calls community effects, as well as organizational effects. Community effects are the impacts that a more diverse police force would have on interactions with the community they serve. Five Thirty Eight reported that among the 75 cities with the largest police departments in the US, on average 60% of the police officers lived outside of the city limits. Diversity in hiring also means being more intentional about hiring police who are from the communities they serve. In many cases this would also impact diversity of the front-line staffing.  

2.  What are the most important counter-forces that may hinder the impact of demographic change in the police workforce on front-line police work?  
Sklansky also mentions this in his article-- the idea that a woman or minority police officer may lose some credibility with their non-police community by joining the police force. This perception could undermine the desired impact of diversifying hiring.  

3.  What, if anything, can police managers and outside stakeholders do to combat them?  
Management buy-in on the positive impacts of increasing diversity in the front-line staffing is one of the most important ways to instill lasting organizational change. The PERF report highlighted success in Fairfax, Virgina, which revamped recruiting efforts as a "holistic approach" to hiring, involving the entire department and multiple different outreach strategies.  

4.  How do the specific features of police organizations, police work, and police history mediate the impact of workplace diversity in the policing context?  
The historical context of police interactions with communities of color is in tension with the idea of increasing diversity in the police force. The PERF report mentions overcoming negative perceptions of policing when recruiting at HBCUs, noting that students have personal experience in their families of police violence or over-policing in their communities. It will take more than more police officers of color to overcome more than a century of horror stories involving police. 


5.  How might your answers to the questions I posed in the previous bullet points differ for other kinds of public sector organizations?  

Increasing diversity in professional organizations absolutely has to be an active endeavor. It requires near constant reinforcement, or else hiring practices return to informal networks. People get jobs, or referrals to jobs, or examples of success in jobs, from people they know, or friends of their friends, etc. These informal networks, just because of the structure and history of American society, tend to be relatively segregated, perpetuating networks of exclusion.  

Notes: 
"Women are seriously underrepresented in policing, making up only around 13 percent of full-time sworn officers in local police agencies and 7 percent of sworn state troopers."
"Agencies should create or expand family-friendly policies and resources that support women (and men) in balancing the demands of the job and the needs of their families"

### The Concept of Strategic Management

Questions: 
1.  What are the key features of this conventional wisdom (about the role of police executives), and why do Moore and Stephens think it is unsatisfactory? To what extent is this conventional wisdom about the role of police executives similar to or different from the conventional wisdom about the role of other public sector managers?  

Moore and Stephens define the conventional view of the role of police management as finding efficient means to achieve externally mandated goals, through planning, organizing, coordinating, and controlling the organization. They find this definition of the role lacking because police managers are increasingly called on to face challenges further outside their original remit, as well as increasing crime from expanding cities and challenging funding environments (of the 1990s). The orthodox view of public managers rings true for some sectors and less for others. For example, after the election of Brandon Johnson as mayor of Chicago, there was a lot of speculation about who he would appoint as president of the school board because of his own history as a teacher and CTU organizer, and whether that appointment would be a new direction for the school board and management of CPS more generally. In contrast, the discussions around the police chief role were about crime rates and not much else.  

2.  How do society’s expectations of private sector managers seem to differ from its expectations of police chiefs and other public sector managers?  

Private managers are expected to assess the (market) environment, and identify opportunities to create value (for shareholders). They are given leeway to experiment with different approaches and initiatives to achieve the end goal of profit-making.  
Public managers are expected to be stewards of public assets, and to be efficient in their use of those assets. Public managers are not expected to critically examine the organizational mission or experiment with new ideas on organizational strategy. Moore characterizes the standard view of public managers as "technicians rather than "strategists."  
This view carries over to expectations of police chiefs, who are expected to put their efforts towards the primary goal of the organization -- crime reduction. This can be seen in media coverage of whenever a new police chief is hired in a major American city. Chiefs are judged by the crime rates, and what their record says about their fitness for the job. Not many police chiefs are hired for their views on reframing the police relationship with the community.  

3.  Why is it more difficult to evaluate a public sector organization’s strategy than it is to evaluate a corporate strategy? How is a police chief or any other public sector manager supposed to know whether the strategy she has defined is a good one?  
It is more difficult to judge a public sector organization's strategy because it is not judged in terms of balance sheets and profits. This is why media coverage of the Postal Service is so maddening. The USPS is not a business, and budget deficits are not the same thing as losses. It is a public service written into the gosh darn Constitution. In the same way, police departments cannot be judged solely on their stewardship of budgets, and the metrics for success such as crime rates can be difficult to convey to the public with the right amount of caution and nuance. Stephens and Moore contend that political enthusiasm for new initiatives, as well as any results from those initiatives, should be the barometer of success for public managers. 

4.  Do police chiefs and other public managers have the discretion they need to play a role in rethinking their organization’s strategy? Should they? Don’t the legislative and judicial branches tell a police department what to do? What role, if any, is left for police managers?  
5.  What are the strengths and weaknesses of this traditional strategy from the perspective of the strategic triangle?  

Reading notes: 
-  public managers are people who have been entrusted with stewardship of a bundle of public assets.  
"We are inclined to view imagination and initiative among (unelected) public sector executives as dangerous and contrary to the public interest, while we perceive exactly the same qualities among private sector executives as a not only tolerable but ultimately conduze to socierty's economic welfare." (p.19).  
By discouraging [entrepreneurial thoughts and initiatives], society denies managers the opportunity to combine their knowledge of "public demands with access to resources and controlo of operational capatity to produce value" (p. 19).  
"Instead of simply devising the means for achieving mandated purposes, they become important agents in helping to discover and define what would be valuable to do." (p. 20).  

TLDR: Managers as strategists rather than technicians.  

Strategic triangle:  
-  whether the purpose is publicly valuable  
-  whether it will be politically and legally supported  
-  whether it is admistratively and operationally feasible
