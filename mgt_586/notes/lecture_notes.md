### Training and Wellness 
Managers have a role in providing training and access to skills to their employees. In the context of the police, training in controlling the use of force.  
Whenever there's another police violence indicent, there's a call from politicians to increase training.  

James Fyfe thinks training does make sense when it's done well.  
-  Helps police keep their cool 
-  Difference between brutal force and unnecessary force.  

What traits does Effective Training have?
-  **realistic (Scenario based)**: roleplay when people can carry out training and tactics in an artificial environment. scenarios should involve the entire process, not just the "final" scene, what is the lead-up. If you only train on that, then you ignore important opportunities to reduce the use of force __before__ the incident.  
-  **focused on very specific problems**: that officers frequently encounter. So they can build up the skills to deal with those situations.  e.g. SWAT team trainings develop a specific type of skills to deal with a specific scenario, such as barricaded suspect or hostage situation.  
-  **training tailored to the local context**: training should be updated in light of the demographic compositions of the area, as well as customized to sitations common to the local environment. most common kinds of scenarios that arise in one community are not necessarily the most common situation in another community.  
-  **good training is frequent and continual**: there should be opportunities for training on a regular basis, and not just in police academy.  
-  **training should be evaluated**: there should be a process for evaluating the effectiveness of the training.  
    -  e.g. sending out officers with mental health professionals on calls where a person is in distress.  
-  **don't make officers overly paranoid**: specific types of training socializes police into a paranoid mindset ('danger imperative') that sets up police officers to constant view their community as dangers to their life.  

Evidence: police field has been conducting evaluations of training for a long time, longer than most fields. Howver police training is so context-specific that it's hard to develop a consensus around what works in terms of evidence-based training reforms.  

#### Training, cont'd.  

-  Police departments have positions for officers to keep track of the latest research on training and best practices.  
-  CALEA: Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies -- organization focused on developing standards and training for police departments.  
-  IACP: International Association of Chiefs of Police -- also develops standards and training for police departments.  

>  SWAT Calls: Example of heirachical operation where trainings offer structure that mirror what happens in a real-life situation.  

#### Dangers in policing:  
-  police training that focus on danger on the job can sometimes seem fantastical in the hypotheticals, but officers do face danger on the job.  
-  How do we avoid the problem of paranoia while still providing skills that will keep officers safe in a variety of situations.  

### Implicit Bias Training  

-  Many states passed laws requiring police departments to provide implicit bias training following the death of George Floyd.

From last time:
- Complaints are useful and can give insight into what the public thinks about how front-line workers are doing.

Policing is an interesting case for performance management and complaint processing because of the importance of complaints to improvement.

Case of public sector org where how the org is dealing with complaints is a part of the broader reform movement.

Complaints as reform:
- Departments make an effort to make complaints accessible to the public.
    - Departments interested in reform should make efforts to do that.
- Attend to language and cultural barriers to lodging complaints.
- Make sure officers are not discouraging complaints.
- Monitor the urge to downgrade/screen out complaints.
    - There's an incentive to resist filing and dealing with complaints informally.
- Conduct quality investigations. 
- Reach fair and timely conclusions to investigations.
- A good complaint system feeds information to the larger organization.

### Accountability Tools:
(so far)

1. Complaint monitoring.
2. Performance measures. 
3. Complaint investigations.

(today)

4. Qualitative case reviews (experimentalist control).
    - Investigate cases, with attention to the surrounding context.
    - Expert reviewers deliberate in groups about each case.

### Qualitative Case Reviews

Sentinel case reviews:
- Detailed scrutiny/learning-oriented reviews to improve practices.
    - Social workers, air traffic controllers, child welfare, and the medical profession use these models as well.

This approach is more holistic than _just_ a compliance review.

### From last time:  
COMPSTAT as a major performance management tool.  

What distinguished compstat from other tools was that it was timely, and that bratton, etal tried to tie the performance measurement to action (promotions, discipline, etc)  

Why is this controversial: 
-  NYC was safer from the perspective of crime data, but the perspective of what is safer missed some of what was actually made the city safer in a more comprehensive sense.  

> "Crime statistics have become the department's bottom line, the best indicator of how the police are doing, precint by precint and citywide" -- William Bratton, "Measuring what matters"  

### Discussion  
-  can the controversy be addressed within the confines of COMPSTAT measurement?  

### Some ofht eproblems with performance measurement  
1.  ends-justifies-the-means syndrome:
    -  by putting too much pressure on police to achieve certain outcomes, the police are motivated to commit misconduct in order to achieve those outcomes.  
    -  "focus on ends, if not matched by effective controls on the means, can lead to behaviors that are inwise, risky, or illegal" (Sparrow)  
    -  performance management is fine as fast as it goes, but it needs to be supplemented by compliance monitoring.  
2.  the complexity of the public sector ends/goals:  
    -  crime reduction and enforcement activity are not the only things that matter, what also matters is community sentiment.  
    -  need a more nuanced view of performance measurement.  

>  There is an alternative to thinking of performance measurement as creating an informative picture of the working environment.  No single dial in the cockpit tells the pilot how well they are doing -- they are used in relation to each other, not as indicators of performance.  

### Discussion  
-  fudging of the numbers -- sometimes what's reported in compstat is accurate but maybe not reflective of reality.  
-  stats do not take in the full context of the numbers.  

### bottom line  
1.  use performance _management_, not just performance measurement.  
2.  do everything possible to ensure that performanes measures provide a comperhensive picture of organizational performance (and/or) supplement with other accountability tools).  
3.  audit the data  

### accountability tools  
1.  compliance monitoring  (bureaucratic control)  
    -  define standard operating procedures  
    -  monitor performance for compliance with SOPs.  
2.  performance measures (outcome-based control)  
    -  defined by desired outcomes  
    -  count how frequently they occur.  
3.  complaint investigations (adjudicatory control)  
    -  accept complaints  
    -  investigate allegations  
4.  qualitative case reviews (experimentalist control)  
    -  investigate cases, with attention to surrounding context.  
    -  expert reviewers deliberate in grouips about each cas.e  

### complaints, why do organizations do this?  

#### benefits  
-  to gather experience from the end-user  
    -  external review, might be less biased, more independent.  
#### limitations  
-  administrative burden -- complaint investigations are time comsunring!  
-  you won't get comphrenesive picture for a number of reasons.  
-  positive comments are not registered  
-  subjectivity could be a problem: it's possible that it's a conflict of interest, or some malicious reason to lodge a complaint unrelated to conduct.  
-  why should the police (as experts) take complaints seriously.  
-  complaints are often withdrawn.

### Compliance Monitoring, II  

What types of excessive force did DOJ find in Ferguson? 
-  dogs  
-  tasers 

~~Why is this happening?~~  
Wrong question!  
Major point of thinking about management of organizations is breaking down the tools that managers have for making change.  
One strategy is to break down the specific tools that are in place 

#### Compliance Monitoring 
1. Set rules  
2. monitor compliance with the rules  
   a.  document practice  
   b.  review whetehr ractice complies with teh rules 

Absence of meaningful compliance monitoring is one aspect of how 

Right question: Does poor compliance monitoring contirbute to the problem (in Ferguson)?  
1.  Inadequate rules  
    -  "Policy ...permits the use of a canine... when any crime -- not just a felony or violent crime-- has been committed"  

Biggest problem in Ferguson was not the rules but whether people were following the rules. 

2.  Inadequate monitoring:  
    a.  Failure to accurately document front-line work  
    b.  failure to rigorouslty evaluate whether it complies with the rules.  
    
    e.g.
    -  Officers did not rerpotr the force they used at all.  
    -  Supoervisors either do not understand or choose not to follow the FPDs use-of-force policy  
    -  Even when force is reported, the force review process falls so short of FPD's policyt requirements that it is ineffective at ...ensuring that force is used properly.  

What can be done about this?  

1.  Strengthen Rules  
    -  FPD will ensure that officers will not deploy canines against individuals suspected to be juveniles/suffering from mental health issues.  
2.  Sterengthem monitoring:  
    -  Strengthen and Accurately document use of force:  "Officers who use of observe a reportable use of force but do not report it will be disciplined, up to and including termination."  
    -  Strengthen comp[liance reviews/ Rigorousy evaluate whether it complies with the rules.  
<br>
  
When DOJ issues reports on constitutional violations in a police department, the result is usually a Consent Decree.  
Once a Police Department enters into a Consent Decree with a city, the DOJ sends a compliance team to engage in oversight of the police department, who can both recommend changes in policies and practices (which the municipality has to pay for).  
<br> 

##### Concerns about the olimits of just instituting more tules and regulations   
-  Argument that you need to change police culture.  
    -  one tool of changing culture is through new rules.  

<br> 

### Logic of compliance onitoring
-  We can do a little bit to contrl behavior by making sure that supervisory staff are making sure that front-line workers are abiding by policies.  
-  who is monitoring the supervisors: DOJ and fedeeral courts.  
-  It might also be the local government that oversees the police departments.  
-  Mechanisms for enforcement are discussed in the next section of the course.  
-  The public and the media alsop plays a role in compliance monitoring  

TLDR:  If an organization wants to enforce compiance in their org, they can institute compliance monitoring throug these mechanism. **This is not a sufficient condition**. The policies and compliance rulkes cannot install the motivation to care about use-0of-force complinace.  

Context:  
Ferguson was a sundown town. At the time Michael Brown was killed 90% of the police force was white, only 1 city councilmemb er was Balck. Eventually the power structure in Ferguson did change and diversify.  
In this way political oversight of the police department has changed, but they still faced the question of what tools does the new leadership have to influecne what police officers do on any given day?  
**That is where compliance monitoring canplay a role.** It is one tool that managers can utilize.  

##### None of the managerial tools alone that we talk about will be effective in completely changing police training and use-of-force, but they can all be tools in creating the right environment. Compliance monitoreing can be a useful tool for setting minimjum standards.  

### Wrap up: Compliance monitoring  

1.  Set clear rules  
2.  Monitor practice for compliance with rules  
    -  accurately document front-line work  
    -  rigorouslyt evaluate whether it complies with the ruels  

This method has also been used for other poicies aside frmo use-of-force. NYPD did this to reduce and improve the quality of stop-and-frisk. Another example is sexual harassment training.

### Performance Measurement  

Readings: Assertive Policing, Plummeting Crime: The NYPD Takes on Crime in New York City  

Development of COMPSTAT:  

What was distinctive about the COMPSTAT program?  
-  The speed of reporting was a weekly crime report, which was new at the time.  
-  This was in contrast to annual reports and longer term performance measures. Allowed decision-making in real-time.  

Constant, real-time information of COMPSTAT -- and the fact that it was a battle to initiate compliance reporting.  

What are the key elementes of COMPSTAT?
-  Rapid performance measurement, and tied to professional accomplishment.  
-  Information was tied to consequences.  
-  Extent to which COMPSTAT was action oriented.  
-  Was not just performance measurement, but also performance management.  
-  Bratton used flexibility as a manager to incentivize effective performance at COMPSTAT and promoted people who did well.  
-  Average age of commanders dropped under Bratton.

-  COMPSTAT statistics were presented weekly and investigators were required to report the numbers and answer questions on them.  
-  Incentivized police to take the trends seriously  
-  Part of an effort to shape the culture (goal to reduce crime by 40%)  

Other impacts:  
-  COMPSTAT implemented alongside "Broken Windows" policy.  
-  In partnership with "Assertive Policing" leading to increase in allegations of police misconduct and aggressive policing.  
-  Changes incentives for officers -- "teaching to the test", "making arrests for the numbers".  
    -  Goal was to change the incentives -- but need to be careful about _how_ it changed the incentives.  

<br>  

Could a better system than COMPSTAT be designed?
