Debates!  
Topic: Procedural Justice  
Procedural Justice: Humanistic approach to policing -- treating people with dignity and respect.  
Four principles:  
-  treating people with dignity and respect
-  giving people a voice during encounters  
-  being neutral and transparent in decision-making  
-  conveying trustworthy motives  

Pro: 
-  encourages police to build relationships with community members  
-  encourages community compliance with police to solve problems  
-  more focused on police treating community fairly and having positive interactions  
-  focused more on persuasion than coercion and use-of-force  
-  success metric is degree of trust in police by community 

Method:  
-  internal and external method
-  officers that perceive respect and dignity from their supervisors are more likely to accept departmental policy  
-  officers are encouraged to have more than just criminal enforcement interactions with community members  

Con:  
-  how to measure trust  
    -  lack of will 
    -  hard to measure 
-  persuasion instead of reform  
    -  focused on public perception over police actions  
        -  in australia example, police persuaded random drunk driving stops were legitimate  
-  public perception can be inaccurate or influenced  
    -  public perception can be influenced by media

### Precision Policing  

Pro:
-  evidence-based crime prevention  
-  neighborhood policing  
-  transparency and tracking  
-  professional education  

Con:
-  data is not neutral  
-  not financially feasible for smaller departments  
-  possible over-policing of certain neighborhoods (and minority groups)  



## 2023-10-03  
From last time:
- The role that systems of discipline could play in regulating police misconduct.  

Lots of police misconduct systems don't often do that. The reasons they do not are complicated. 
-  there are lots of employee protections for public employees
-  the hard part is protecting employees due process protections while also strengthening accountability for bad actors.  

The big picture: the positive goal of any discipline system is to punish misconduct and sending a message about conduct that won't be tolerated.  

### how do early intervention systems fit into this picture  
-  flagging employees who have the potential to engage in misconduct   
-  works with indicators (varies by department): 
    -  gives people a specific score based on a number of indicators, rather than a single behavior.
    -  gives a broader picture of performance  

Distinction between monitoring individual instances of misconduct and monitoring the overall performance of the department.
How is this different from performance management?  
-  alternative way of doing the same thing in a rigorous format  
-  grounded in metrics about work employee has actually done vs. managers annual review of employee performance.  

How are the early intervention systems different?  
-  not as much about sanctioning poor work, instead are more about reforming behavior  
-  emphasis on intervention to address issues before they become more problematic  

### walker and archbold  
-  good early intervention system is complex  
what should be considered in the design of an EIS?  
-  what factors to use?  
-  what kinds of triggers are these?  
    -  complaints  
    -  legal/civil suits  
    -  the number of traumatic incidents that the officer has been involved in  
    -  number of sick days (could be an indicator of stress or substance abuse)  
Example: Portland.  
-  shift force ration  
-  force ration  
-  force count  
-  criminal complaint  
-  complaint in same category
-  complaint count  
-  traumatic incidents  

Issues:  
-  Some EIS policies do not allow for a certain amoutn of discretion.
-  Some policies do not explicitly use comparisons to peer employees as part of triggers for review  

### Challenges of EIS  
-  actual buy-in  
-  data reliability (on complaints and other indicators)  
-  getting people access to training and reform programs  
-  good EIS systems take time and require resources  

### Organizational Strategy   

Last unit in the class!  
This topic is maybe not the first thing you think of when you think of a public manager.  
-  public managers are supposed to be concerned with administration  
-  another more intangible role that a manager can play that has to do with setting organizational direction.  

topic of organizational strategy can be a bit amorphous  

Org. Strategy can be done well and can be done poorly  
-  everyone has experience thinking of strengths and weaknesses in break-out sessions that don't go anywhere.  

It's still important because if you plug people into a broken system, you will end up with bad results.  

important reason for strategic thinking:  
-  organizatoins get in ruts; strong tendency to keep doing what they've been doing.  
-  article by robert k. merton: tendency for organizations to lose sight of their original goals, and instead focus on maintaining existing rules and mode sof work.  

Strategic thinking is supposed to be an antidote to this kind of calcifying thinking.  
-  thinking more about the results themselves vs usual organizational routines.  

Strategic thinking has been important in private management concepts.  Mark Moore based his thinking on the private sector model.  
-  based in part on writings of people like david drucker.  
-  drucker: you should think about your management in terms of creating value for your customers.  
    -  focus should also be put on whether the business is doing the right thing in the first place. understand what the customer wants.  

this is not the way that we generally think of non-profit and public sector managers.  
-  moore: inclined to view imagination and initiative among (unelected) publc sector executives as dangerous and contrary to the public welfare.  

### Moore's model of strategic thinking  
-  strategic thinking for public managers is about thinking about the public value that the organization is trying to create.  

In creating public value, police chiefs should be acting more in this entrepreneurial way.  
-  this could be unreasonable at this time, when police departments are seen to be out of control.  
-  does this frame of mind make sense in 2023 in the environment of policing in america.  

For all the concerns we have about "entrepreneurship" in police management strategies --  the question could be posed what is the alternative?  
-  maintaining the status quo of the historical management strategy of policing makes sense in the current moment.  
-  for example: does the focus on call response and crime reduction make sense in the context of a carceral state and punitive judicial environment.  

#### it's possible the fundamentally rethiking police strategy should not be the remit of police chiefs or managers  
-  moore and stephens agree: the role of outside stakeholders argue that shaping legitimate police strategies is an important facet of the aim of creating public value.  


- much more complex to judge entrepreneurial success in the public sector than in the private sector.  

Moore suggests using the the strategic triangle:  
-  the three corners of the triangle are:  
    -  substantive value: task environment  
    -  operational feasability: distinctive competence  
    -  political feasability: authorizing environment  

A responsible manager is asking these hard questions:  
-  what is my argument for rethinking this police department along the lines of community policing model?  
-  is this policitally feasible? Will city hall support this?  
-  is this operationally feasible? Is reoriantation a realistic endeavor?  

This is what Moore wants people to think about when trying to imagine a new strategy for police reform.

Hiring practices -- wrap up 

-  rationale for civil rights leaders to push for Black police officers 
    -  hope was that black officers would be less abusive towards black community members. 
    -  cultivate community trust and cooperation 
    -  take public safety concerns in black neighborhoods more seriously.
    -  gain access to stable and well-paying jobs for black job-seekers.

-  unanticipated challenges of the success in hiring of black officers  
    -  exposed issues of class dynamics and issues of class disparity within the black community  
    -  black officers were not allowed to police in white areas  
    -  officers are being integrated into a system that has its own systems and practices
    -  black officers do not get the same assignments that white officers do.

### discipline  

#### christopher commission (1991)  

-  investigated the use-of-force by the lapd after the rodney king beating  
-  found that a handful of officers had a disproportionate number of complaints against them
    -  bad apples officers hypothesis  
-  if police depts focused on these officers, they could reduce the number of complaints and use-of-force complaints agains the department  
-  found that most officers (even in high crime districts) were able to get through the year with few or no use of force complaints, so those high complaint officers were outliers.  
-  < 0.5% of officers accounted for 1 in 7 excessive force complaints against the lapd  

#### chalfin paper  
-  critique of early intervention frameworks  
-  the problem is that the 0.5% statistic is a statistical artifact, there will always be a small number of officers who have a disproportionate number of complaints against them.  
-  simulation removing the problem officers from the dataset does not substantially reduce the number of complaints.  
-  it is difficult to predict who will become a problem officer in the future.  
-  critique: paper ignores the cultural impact of sanctioning bad officers.  

### some functions of discipline & employee review  
-  incapacitation: removing bad officers from the force so they can't abuse their authority.  
-  reform: help bad cops do better  
-  deterrence: remove/sanction bad cops to show other cops what is not allowed  
-  prevent social contagion: remove/sanction/reform bad cops so they don't spoil the bunch.  
-  punishment: remove/sanction bad cops to deliver justice  

### Discipline systems  
why is it so hard to fire/punish bad officers? 
-  simple answer: disciplinary systems for deparments are complex, with lots of opportunities for appeal  
-  a lot of the protections for police officers stem from employment protections and protecting standards against arbitrariness from management, put in place by unions.  
-  chicago: requirement that any disciplinary action be based on "past precedent"  
    -  established to protect black officers singled out by racist managers for harsher discipline.  
-  employee protections for public employees are a big chunk of how difficult to fire police officers.  

### due process in discipline systems  
-  supposed to protect against arbitrary and unjust punishment  
-  employees have a right to various due process protections  
-  fair notice
-  voice in the process
-  fair/neutral investigation of allegations  
-  right to appeal  

>  these are generic principles that everyone agrees to for public employees

### common problems in police discipline systems
-  poor quality of investigations
-  long timelines  
-  specific protections that don't advance due process  

### how to improve the process 
-  improving the quality of investigations  
-  


### 2023-09-26

From last time: 
Politicians and police leaders can look at technology as a solution to policing issues.  
-  replace guns with tasers, killings will decrease  
-  if we use shotspotter, then we can reduce gun violence  

Historical note: when 911 call system was first introduced, it was thought that it would dramatically reduce crimes.  

These are examples of different extremes of solutionism -- the idea that technology can solve problems.  

Problem is attributing causal power to technology without taking into account the context and environment into which these tools and technology is deployed.  
e.g. the inventor of the taser thought it would reduce police homicide when they needed to immobilize people. In practice, police had different uses for them.  
-  in sum, you have to think carefully about the ways in which police will use the new technology in ways that you don't anticipate. 

-  shouldn't think about whether the body camera works, but rather if a package of policies: body cameras, training, and other reforms, will work.  

Bruno Latour (philosopher): Have to think about assemblages of technologies and people, instead of just tools. 

#### There are some tools where it might be possible that a specific tool is intrinsically unacceptable: such as police dogs
-  dogs are trained to bite  
-  in this case, are dogs more similar to chemical weapons, in that they both violate the agreed upon standards the use of force in policing.  
-  example of the technology itself, independent of any governance or assemblages (social or organizational arrangements) around it, could be unacceptable.  


Concerns about legal liability: 
-  rollout of new technologies should be done in such a way that also examines the potential for legal liability of new situations that can be addressed by new tools.  

### Today: Hiring and recruitment  

-  how police managers shape the police force themselves  

Hiring strategies:  
-  central part of organizational change in many management fields  
-  in policing, requires the use of discretion  
-  you can't write rules or specify processes for all the work police do to the same extent that you can for other types of work.  

At the end of the day, police officers have to exercise a lot of judgement:  
-  how do you get more people with those characteristics into the field of policing  

Smarter approach to police hiring might be used to advance the goals of police reform  

### what the process generally looks like   

-  in general, police hiring tends to be more elaborate than hiring in other fields, even other public sector fields.  
    -  lots of the hiring processes are defined by the state that local departments have to follow.  

Typical police hiring includes these things: 

1.  written exam 
2.  Extensive background check: interviewing friends and neighbors, reviewing social media, criminal background. 
3.  psychological exam  
4.  physical fitness test  

#### testing 

criteria that we're currently using to filter hiring should be excamined
-  what implicit values are baked into these tests? 
-  scoring on psych exam predicts your performance on the job as a police officer  
-  mostly saying that your performance predicts the scores that your trainers give you in police academy, and the ratings your supervisors give you on the job.  
    -  if they're grading to a specific mindset (authoritarian, cruel), then these indicators 

> changing these standards would and has faced pushback from police departments  
If we meaningfully want to change police departments going forward, we are going to have to rethink the entire process.  

Note: growth of civilians in police departments.  non-sworn officers like call takers, analysts, etc still have to go through a byzantine process, but they don't have to go through some of the same physical tests, etc. But many people are hired as front-line patrol officers, and you go up or somewhere else from there. 

### diversity in policing  

-  to what extent do police officers look like the communities they serve in
-  emphasis on diverse police forces began with the passage of civil rights groups  
-  policing -- like everywhere else -- there were precursors to diversifying the employee workforce. 
-  significant changes in demographics in policing nationally came in the 1960s  

-  employment discrimination: washington vs. davis (1975) -- employment discrimination in the dc police department
    -  lots of other lawsuits like this in the 1970s.  
-  reformers wanted to make the hiring process less reliant on patronage networks (early 20th century) 
-  the exams did have a disparate impact -- african americans passed at lower rates than white applicants.  

End result: lots of these lawsuits were successful, and had a major impact on the hiring process.  
    -  lots of police departments were ordered to change their testing process
    -  some police departments had quotas imposed on them  

### changes in police departments over time  
-  historically the overall trend nationally is great diversity in policing  
-  1997 - 2916: female police officers went from 10% to ~12%  
-  30x30 initiative: effort to increase female percentage of police workforce to 30% by 2030  
-  there has been some movement to include and diversify among gender identities in police departments.  

### why did people argue for diversifying 

1.  competency effects: to change the character of the police department 
    -  minority officers may less abusive towards minority communities
    -  minotity officers may be more effective at policing minority communities
    -  minority officers have different skills 
2.  community effects: 
    -  increasing trust in community  
    -  increasing legitimacy of police  
3.  organizational effects
    -  more diverse officers might take crime in minority communities more seriously
    -  dynamics of the organization might change when it is exposed to a more diverse workforce.  
    -  police unions -- in big cities, there might be a black officers association bringing a different voice to issues  




## 2023-09-19
### Training and Wellness 
Managers have a role in providing training and access to skills to their employees. In the context of the police, training in controlling the use of force.  
Whenever there's another police violence indicent, there's a call from politicians to increase training.  

James Fyfe thinks training does make sense when it's done well.  
-  Helps police keep their cool 
-  Difference between brutal force and unnecessary force.  

What traits does Effective Training have?
-  **realistic (Scenario based)**: roleplay when people can carry out training and tactics in an artificial environment. scenarios should involve the entire process, not just the "final" scene, what is the lead-up. If you only train on that, then you ignore important opportunities to reduce the use of force __before__ the incident.  
-  **focused on very specific problems**: that officers frequently encounter. So they can build up the skills to deal with those situations.  e.g. SWAT team trainings develop a specific type of skills to deal with a specific scenario, such as barricaded suspect or hostage situation.  
-  **training tailored to the local context**: training should be updated in light of the demographic compositions of the area, as well as customized to sitations common to the local environment. most common kinds of scenarios that arise in one community are not necessarily the most common situation in another community.  
-  **good training is frequent and continual**: there should be opportunities for training on a regular basis, and not just in police academy.  
-  **training should be evaluated**: there should be a process for evaluating the effectiveness of the training.  
    -  e.g. sending out officers with mental health professionals on calls where a person is in distress.  
-  **don't make officers overly paranoid**: specific types of training socializes police into a paranoid mindset ('danger imperative') that sets up police officers to constant view their community as dangers to their life.  

Evidence: police field has been conducting evaluations of training for a long time, longer than most fields. Howver police training is so context-specific that it's hard to develop a consensus around what works in terms of evidence-based training reforms.  

#### Training, cont'd.  

-  Police departments have positions for officers to keep track of the latest research on training and best practices.  
-  CALEA: Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies -- organization focused on developing standards and training for police departments.  
-  IACP: International Association of Chiefs of Police -- also develops standards and training for police departments.  

>  SWAT Calls: Example of heirachical operation where trainings offer structure that mirror what happens in a real-life situation.  

#### Dangers in policing:  
-  police training that focus on danger on the job can sometimes seem fantastical in the hypotheticals, but officers do face danger on the job.  
-  How do we avoid the problem of paranoia while still providing skills that will keep officers safe in a variety of situations.  

### Implicit Bias Training  

-  Many states passed laws requiring police departments to provide implicit bias training following the death of George Floyd.  





## 2023-09-14
From last time:
- Complaints are useful and can give insight into what the public thinks about how front-line workers are doing.

Policing is an interesting case for performance management and complaint processing because of the importance of complaints to improvement.

Case of public sector org where how the org is dealing with complaints is a part of the broader reform movement.

Complaints as reform:
- Departments make an effort to make complaints accessible to the public.
    - Departments interested in reform should make efforts to do that.
- Attend to language and cultural barriers to lodging complaints.
- Make sure officers are not discouraging complaints.
- Monitor the urge to downgrade/screen out complaints.
    - There's an incentive to resist filing and dealing with complaints informally.
- Conduct quality investigations. 
- Reach fair and timely conclusions to investigations.
- A good complaint system feeds information to the larger organization.

### Accountability Tools:
(so far)

1. Complaint monitoring.
2. Performance measures. 
3. Complaint investigations.

(today)

4. Qualitative case reviews (experimentalist control).
    - Investigate cases, with attention to the surrounding context.
    - Expert reviewers deliberate in groups about each case.

### Qualitative Case Reviews

Sentinel case reviews:
- Detailed scrutiny/learning-oriented reviews to improve practices.
    - Social workers, air traffic controllers, child welfare, and the medical profession use these models as well.

This approach is more holistic than _just_ a compliance review.  


## 2023-09-12  
### From last time:  
COMPSTAT as a major performance management tool.  

What distinguished compstat from other tools was that it was timely, and that bratton, etal tried to tie the performance measurement to action (promotions, discipline, etc)  

Why is this controversial: 
-  NYC was safer from the perspective of crime data, but the perspective of what is safer missed some of what was actually made the city safer in a more comprehensive sense.  

> "Crime statistics have become the department's bottom line, the best indicator of how the police are doing, precint by precint and citywide" -- William Bratton, "Measuring what matters"  

### Discussion  
-  can the controversy be addressed within the confines of COMPSTAT measurement?  

### Some ofht eproblems with performance measurement  
1.  ends-justifies-the-means syndrome:
    -  by putting too much pressure on police to achieve certain outcomes, the police are motivated to commit misconduct in order to achieve those outcomes.  
    -  "focus on ends, if not matched by effective controls on the means, can lead to behaviors that are inwise, risky, or illegal" (Sparrow)  
    -  performance management is fine as fast as it goes, but it needs to be supplemented by compliance monitoring.  
2.  the complexity of the public sector ends/goals:  
    -  crime reduction and enforcement activity are not the only things that matter, what also matters is community sentiment.  
    -  need a more nuanced view of performance measurement.  

>  There is an alternative to thinking of performance measurement as creating an informative picture of the working environment.  No single dial in the cockpit tells the pilot how well they are doing -- they are used in relation to each other, not as indicators of performance.  

### Discussion  
-  fudging of the numbers -- sometimes what's reported in compstat is accurate but maybe not reflective of reality.  
-  stats do not take in the full context of the numbers.  

### bottom line  
1.  use performance _management_, not just performance measurement.  
2.  do everything possible to ensure that performanes measures provide a comperhensive picture of organizational performance (and/or) supplement with other accountability tools).  
3.  audit the data  

### accountability tools  
1.  compliance monitoring  (bureaucratic control)  
    -  define standard operating procedures  
    -  monitor performance for compliance with SOPs.  
2.  performance measures (outcome-based control)  
    -  defined by desired outcomes  
    -  count how frequently they occur.  
3.  complaint investigations (adjudicatory control)  
    -  accept complaints  
    -  investigate allegations  
4.  qualitative case reviews (experimentalist control)  
    -  investigate cases, with attention to surrounding context.  
    -  expert reviewers deliberate in grouips about each cas.e  

### complaints, why do organizations do this?  

#### benefits  
-  to gather experience from the end-user  
    -  external review, might be less biased, more independent.  
#### limitations  
-  administrative burden -- complaint investigations are time comsunring!  
-  you won't get comphrenesive picture for a number of reasons.  
-  positive comments are not registered  
-  subjectivity could be a problem: it's possible that it's a conflict of interest, or some malicious reason to lodge a complaint unrelated to conduct.  
-  why should the police (as experts) take complaints seriously.  
-  complaints are often withdrawn.  

#### to be continued...

### Compliance Monitoring, II  

What types of excessive force did DOJ find in Ferguson? 
-  dogs  
-  tasers 

~~Why is this happening?~~  
Wrong question!  
Major point of thinking about management of organizations is breaking down the tools that managers have for making change.  
One strategy is to break down the specific tools that are in place 

#### Compliance Monitoring 
1. Set rules  
2. monitor compliance with the rules  
   a.  document practice  
   b.  review whetehr ractice complies with teh rules 

Absence of meaningful compliance monitoring is one aspect of how 

Right question: Does poor compliance monitoring contirbute to the problem (in Ferguson)?  
1.  Inadequate rules  
    -  "Policy ...permits the use of a canine... when any crime -- not just a felony or violent crime-- has been committed"  

Biggest problem in Ferguson was not the rules but whether people were following the rules. 

2.  Inadequate monitoring:  
    a.  Failure to accurately document front-line work  
    b.  failure to rigorouslty evaluate whether it complies with the rules.  
    
    e.g.
    -  Officers did not rerpotr the force they used at all.  
    -  Supoervisors either do not understand or choose not to follow the FPDs use-of-force policy  
    -  Even when force is reported, the force review process falls so short of FPD's policyt requirements that it is ineffective at ...ensuring that force is used properly.  

What can be done about this?  

1.  Strengthen Rules  
    -  FPD will ensure that officers will not deploy canines against individuals suspected to be juveniles/suffering from mental health issues.  
2.  Sterengthem monitoring:  
    -  Strengthen and Accurately document use of force:  "Officers who use of observe a reportable use of force but do not report it will be disciplined, up to and including termination."  
    -  Strengthen comp[liance reviews/ Rigorousy evaluate whether it complies with the rules.  
<br>
  
When DOJ issues reports on constitutional violations in a police department, the result is usually a Consent Decree.  
Once a Police Department enters into a Consent Decree with a city, the DOJ sends a compliance team to engage in oversight of the police department, who can both recommend changes in policies and practices (which the municipality has to pay for).  
<br> 

##### Concerns about the olimits of just instituting more tules and regulations   
-  Argument that you need to change police culture.  
    -  one tool of changing culture is through new rules.  

<br> 

### Logic of compliance onitoring
-  We can do a little bit to contrl behavior by making sure that supervisory staff are making sure that front-line workers are abiding by policies.  
-  who is monitoring the supervisors: DOJ and fedeeral courts.  
-  It might also be the local government that oversees the police departments.  
-  Mechanisms for enforcement are discussed in the next section of the course.  
-  The public and the media alsop plays a role in compliance monitoring  

TLDR:  If an organization wants to enforce compiance in their org, they can institute compliance monitoring throug these mechanism. **This is not a sufficient condition**. The policies and compliance rulkes cannot install the motivation to care about use-0of-force complinace.  

Context:  
Ferguson was a sundown town. At the time Michael Brown was killed 90% of the police force was white, only 1 city councilmemb er was Balck. Eventually the power structure in Ferguson did change and diversify.  
In this way political oversight of the police department has changed, but they still faced the question of what tools does the new leadership have to influecne what police officers do on any given day?  
**That is where compliance monitoring canplay a role.** It is one tool that managers can utilize.  

##### None of the managerial tools alone that we talk about will be effective in completely changing police training and use-of-force, but they can all be tools in creating the right environment. Compliance monitoreing can be a useful tool for setting minimjum standards.  

### Wrap up: Compliance monitoring  

1.  Set clear rules  
2.  Monitor practice for compliance with rules  
    -  accurately document front-line work  
    -  rigorouslyt evaluate whether it complies with the ruels  

This method has also been used for other poicies aside frmo use-of-force. NYPD did this to reduce and improve the quality of stop-and-frisk. Another example is sexual harassment training.

### Performance Measurement  

Readings: Assertive Policing, Plummeting Crime: The NYPD Takes on Crime in New York City  

Development of COMPSTAT:  

What was distinctive about the COMPSTAT program?  
-  The speed of reporting was a weekly crime report, which was new at the time.  
-  This was in contrast to annual reports and longer term performance measures. Allowed decision-making in real-time.  

Constant, real-time information of COMPSTAT -- and the fact that it was a battle to initiate compliance reporting.  

What are the key elementes of COMPSTAT?
-  Rapid performance measurement, and tied to professional accomplishment.  
-  Information was tied to consequences.  
-  Extent to which COMPSTAT was action oriented.  
-  Was not just performance measurement, but also performance management.  
-  Bratton used flexibility as a manager to incentivize effective performance at COMPSTAT and promoted people who did well.  
-  Average age of commanders dropped under Bratton.

-  COMPSTAT statistics were presented weekly and investigators were required to report the numbers and answer questions on them.  
-  Incentivized police to take the trends seriously  
-  Part of an effort to shape the culture (goal to reduce crime by 40%)  

Other impacts:  
-  COMPSTAT implemented alongside "Broken Windows" policy.  
-  In partnership with "Assertive Policing" leading to increase in allegations of police misconduct and aggressive policing.  
-  Changes incentives for officers -- "teaching to the test", "making arrests for the numbers".  
    -  Goal was to change the incentives -- but need to be careful about _how_ it changed the incentives.  

<br>  

Could a better system than COMPSTAT be designed?
