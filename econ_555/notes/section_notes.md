-  answer all parts of teh question  
-  read the questions carefully  
-  write legibly  

### market supply  
early on the marginal costs curve will be downward sloping, but eventually it will be upward sloping.  
-  this happens because of start up costs  

graphing conventions;  
-  price on the vertical axis
-  quantity on the horizontal axis
-  units on both axes
-  quantity refers to a period of time  
-  label the curve  
-  supply curve can be curved or a straight line  

### supply curves are upward sloping  
-  intensive maring = the higher the price, the more each seller produces  
-  extensive margin = the higher the price, the more sellers enter the market  

### 5 factors shifting supply curves  
first 4 are shifters of individual and market supply curves  
1.  input prices
2.  productivity and technology
3.  other opportunities: price of other outputs
4.  expectations
this one shifts only the market supply curve, not individual
5.  type and number of sellers
    -  changes the scaling factor in moving from individual to market supply 

### price of other outputs:  
-  subsitutes in production: alternative uses of your resources.  your supply of a good will decrease if the price of a substitute in production increases.  
-  complements in production: goods that are produced together.  your supply of a good will increase if the price of a complement in production increases.  

### expectations  

short term:
-  selling today is a substitute for selling tomorrow  
-  depends on how storable the good is  

long term:  
-  production today is a cokmplement for production tomorrow
-  if you expect the price of your produce to rise in thte next year, then you want to store your product to sell next year.  

if you expect the price of your product to rise next year, you can increase your profits by storing it and sellign it next year. this will decrease your supply this year (shifting your supply curve to the left) and increase your supply next year (shifting next years supply curve to the right).

### individual demand  
#### The individual demand curve  
-  an individual demand curve is:  
    -  a set of plancs  
    -  based on a point in time  
    -  for a defined market  
    -  holding other things constant  

_"At each price, how many navel oranges am I willing to buy this week?"_  

#### what shapes an individual demand curve?  
-  demand is downward sloping  
    -  law of demand; the quantity demanded is higher when prices are lower.  
    -  _"What quantity will I buy at each price?"_  
-  diminishing marginal benefit: each additional item yields a smaller marginal benefit than the last one.  
    -  _"what price am i willing to pay for each quantity?"_

#### demand is all about marginal benefits  
-  if our future plans follow **the rational rule for buyers**, this means that:  
> Individual Demand Curve = Marginal Benefit Curve  

e.g. gallons of gas @ $3:  

| gallons of gas | marginal benefit | marginal cost | net benefit | 
|---|---|---|---| 
| 1 | 5 | 3 | 2 | 
| 2 | 4 | 3 | 1 | 
| 3 | 3 | 3 | 0 | 
|total benefit | | |3  | 


gallons of gas @ $2:  
| gallons of gas | marginal benefit | marginal cost | net benefit | 
|---|---|---|---| 
| 1 | 5 | 2 | 3 | 
| 2 | 4 | 2 | 2 | 
| 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 
| 4 | 2.5 | 2 | 0.5 | 
| 5 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 
| total benefit |  |  | 6.5 |
