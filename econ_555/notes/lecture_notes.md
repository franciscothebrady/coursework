## 2023-09-27 -- Lecture 9: Equilibrium  

### announcements  
-  ch 3 and ch 4 problem sets due thursday  
-  budget constraint problem set returned today  
-  review session after section on friday  
-  exam sheet of notes  
-  others?  

### agenda

-  recap: market supply curves  
-  equilibrium!  

### last time:  
-  if the price changes: 
    -  movement along the supply curve  
    -  causes an increase or decrease in the quantity supplied  
-  if other factors change  
    -  the supply curve shifts  
        -  shift right is an increase in supply  
        -  shift left is a decrease in supply  

### key takeaways  
-  the market supply curve is the sum of individual supply  
-  five factors shift market supply curves:  
    -  cost of inputs  
    -  productivity and technology  
    -  other opportunities: price of other outputs  
    -  expectations  
    -  number and type of sellers  

-  movements along a supply curve versus shifts in supply  
    -  if the other price changes: movement along the supply curve
    -  if other factors change: shift in supply  

e.g. change in price leads to change in the quantity supplied.  
e.g. change in cost of inputs leads to a change in supply (shift of the curve)  

### parralels between demand and supply  

|    | Demand | Supply |  
| --- | --- | --- |
| your objective | maximize economic surplus: to purchase items you enjoy the most  | maximize profits: to sell goods so as to maximize your profits | 
| to decide on your quantity, follow the: | rational rule for buyers: buy one more item if the marginal benefit exceeds the price | rational rule for sellers: sell one more item if the price exceeds the marginal cost |  
| implying that: | your demand curve is your marginal benefit curve | your supply curve is your marginal cost curve | 
| curve slopes: | demand curve slopes down: because of diminishing marginal benefits | supply curve slopes up: because of increasing marginal costs | 
| the market | market demand curve is the sum of the quantity each individual demands, at each particular price | market supply curve is the sum of the quantity each business supplies, at each particular price | 
| a rise in price causes | a movement along the demand curve, reducing the quantity demanded | a movement along the supply curve, increasing the quantity supplied | 
| a fall in prices causes | a movement along the demand curve, increasing the quantity demanded | a movement along the supply curve, reducing the quantity supplied |  

### roadmap for equilibrium  

-  understnading markets
-  equilibrium  
-  getting to equilibrium
-  predicting market changes  
-  interpreting market data  

### what is a market?  
-  market: any setting that brings together potential buyers ("demanders") and potential sellers ("suppliers")  

you are active in many markets: 
-  shopping: demanding consumer goods  
-  working: suppling labor  
-  getting repairs done: buying skilled labor  
-  saving: supplying credit  
-  borriwing: demanding credit  
-  traveling/tourism: suppling american dollars & demanding foreign currency  
-  legislation: supplying/demanding votes  

### how are markets organized?  
-  markets bring buyers and sellers together  
    -  posted prices  
    -  open outcry  
    -  online  
    -  auction  

### what do markets do?  
-  organize economic activity  
    -  determine what gets produced
    -  how much gets produced
    -  who produces it 
    -  who receives it
    -  at what price is it exchanged  
-  bring potential buyers into contact with potential sellers
    -  transform your desire into a price  
    -  which motivates firms to produce desired products  
-  market outcomes  
    -  are determined by the forces of supply and demand  

## a caveat: 
-  out supply and demand analysis applies to perfect competition  
    -  an identical good is sold
    -  many buyers and sellers, each of whom is a small share of the market  
    -  implies: price takers  

is this a small caveat or a big deal?  
    -  many intuitions extend beyond perfect competition, many don't
    - our task for the rest of the semester: figuring these out.  

### market equilibrium  

-  equilibrium: the point at which there is no tendency to change.  
    -  occurs when quantity demanded = quantity supplied
    -  occurs when price = marginal cost = marginal benefit
        -  where the demand curve intersects the supply curve.
        -  forces of demand and supply are in balance.  
    -  forces pushing prices to rise balanced by forces pushing prices to fall.
    -  neither suppliers nor demanders have an incentive to change their behavior.
        -  no shortage, no surplus.
        - every seller who wants to sell at that price can sell.
        - every buyer who wants to buy at that price can buy.  

equilibrium price: the price at which the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied.
equilibrium quantity: the quantity bought and sold at the equilibrium price.

### equilibrium: where the curves cross 

| price | A quantity demanded | B quantity supplied | quantity supplied - quantity demanded | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $4 | 1.6 | 2.5 | +0.9 (surplus) |
| $3 | 2.0 | 2.0 | 0 (equilibrium: no shortage or surplus) |
| $2 | 2.4 | 1.5 | -0.9 (shortage) |  

-  if the price is too high, a surplus results  
    -  quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded
    -  a surplus  

-  if the price is too low, a shortage results
    -  quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied
    -  a shortage  

### finding equilibrium: set Q_s = Q_d  

$$
Q_d = 3.2 - 0.4P  \\
Q_s = 0.5 + 0.5P  \\

0.5 + 0.5P = 3.2 - 0.4P \\
.9P = 2.7  \\
P = 3  
$$ 

Now we know the price.  
To find the quantity, plug the price into the demand or supply equation.  

$$ 
Q_s = 0.5 + 0.5P \\
= 0.5 + 0.5(3) \\
= 0.5 + 1.5 \\
Q_s = 2
$$

So $Q^*$ = 2, $P^*$ = 3  

### diamond-water paradox

-  water is essential to life, but cheap
-  diamonds are not essential to life, but expensive  
-  why?  

how can we make sense of this paradox?  
1.  market prices reflect supply and demand  
2.  prices are determined at the margin (what is the marginal benefit and marginal cost of the last gallon of water?)  
3.  market prices reflect market forces, rather than fairness 

### how markets get to equilibrium  
when price is above the equilibrium price:  
quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded, and a surplus results.  
-  sellers are desperate to sell, so they will start discounting, pushing prices down.  
-  buyers ask for discounts.  

when price is below the equilibrium price:
quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied, and a shortage results.  
-  sellers realize they can sell at a higher price, so they raise prices.
-  buyers don't want to go without, so offer higher prices  

### 3-step recipe for predicting market outcomes  
1.  is the supply or demand curve shifting (of both?)  
2.  is that shift an increase (shift right) or decrease (shift left)?  
3.  how will prices and quantities change in the new equilibrium?  

### shifts in demand  
1.  shift the demand curve, an increase in demand is a shift to the right; a decrease in demand is a shift to the left.  
2.  establish the new equilibrium price and quantity-- where the new demand curve intersects the supply curve.  
3a.  read off the new equilibrium quantity (and compare it with the old equilibrium quantity)
3b.  read off the new equilibrium price (and compare it with the old equilibrium price)  

### shifts in supply  
1.  shift the supply curve, an increase in supply is a shift to the right; a decrease in supply is a shift to the left.  
2.  establish the new equilibrium price and quantity-- where the new supply curve intersects the demand curve.  
3a. read off the new equilibrium quantity (and compare it with the old equilibrium quantity)  
3b.  read off the new equilibrium price (and compare it with the old equilibrium price)  

### consequences of shifts in supply and demand 
in table form  

| | effect on equilibrium quantity | effect on equilibrium price |
| --- | --- | --- |
| increase in demand | increase | increase |
| decrease in demand | decrease | decrease |
| increase in supply | increase | decrease |
| decrease in supply | decrease | increase |

> shifts in demand cause price and quantity to move in the same direction  

>  shifts in supply cause price and quanty to move in opposite directions  

### finding the new equilibrium
Old: $Q_d$ = 3.2 - 0.4P 
New: $Q_d$ = 2.3 - 0.4P  

$Q_s$ = 0.5 + 0.5P  

Set $Q_s$ = $Q_d$  

$$
0.5 + 0.5P = 2.3 - 0.4P \\
0.9P = 1.8 \\
P = 2 \\
$$  

P = 2, now set P = 2 in $Q_d$  

$$ 
Q_d = 2.3 - 0.4P \\
= 2.3 - 0.4(2) \\
= 2.3 - 0.8 \\
Q_d = 1.5
$$  



## 2023-09-25 -- Lecture 8: Market Supply  

-  Chapter 3, Chapter 4 problem sets due Thursday  
-  practice exams posted  
    -  solutions also posted.  
-  also posted budget constraint problem set  

### supply is all about marginal cost  
-  your individual supply curve is simply graphs of your supply plans  
    -  the quantity you plan to sell, at each price  
    -  holding all else constant  

Following core principles:  
-  keep selling until: price = marginal cost  

Implies: your individual supply curve *is* your marginal cost curve.  

### why do curves supply upward?  
-  upward sloping supply means:  
    -  price increases with quantity 
    -  the higher the price, the higher the quantity supplied.
-  if the price you're willing to sell is your marginal costs  
    -  implies: your marginal increase with quantity.
 
-  supply curves slope up because of:  
    -  increasing marginal costs  
    -  increasing opportunity costs

> At some point, producingeach additionla item comes at a higher marginal cost than the previous item. (due to decreasing marginal product or rising input costs)  

examples: high cost of drilling last gallon of oil, or last bushel of wheat.

### but what if marginal costs aren't always increasing?  
-  sometimes, (at first!) marginal costs are decreasing (benefits of mass production)  

-  for individual suppliers, production decisions should be made where price = marginal costs (on the part of the marginal costs curve where costs are increasing)  
-  for market supply, we need to add up the marginal costs of all suppliers.

### shutdown decisions  

-  if prices are too low, you may be better off shutting down.  
Shutdown condition: if your revenues do not exceee your recoverable (non-sunk) costs.  

-  recall sunk costs can't be avoided 

Note: this is not the same as saying shut down if you make a loss
-  you should shut down if you can't cover your variable costs.

### the logiw we have followed  
1. apply core principles to selling decisions
2. follow the rational rule for sellers 
3. produce where price = marginal cost
4. supply curve is marginal cost curve 
5. your supply curve is your marginal cost curve. 

## how is this useful 

1.  policy analysis  
    -  to find out someone's marginal costs, simply observe their individual supply curve.
        -  marginal cost curves mediate costs/benefits of policies  
2.  forecasting the choices others make
    - if they are trying to make good decisions (following the rational rule)  
3.  advice to you(?) 

### approach to profit maximization (graphical)

-  Revenue = Price * Quantity  
-  Profit ($\pi$) = Revenue - Costs

-  Profit maximization:  
    -  produce where marginal revenue = marginal cost  
    -  or, produce where price = marginal cost  
-  this is the slope of these two lines  
    -  MC is the slope of the supply curve 
    -  MR is the slope of the revenue curve  

-  profit maximizing quantity is maximized where the slope of the MC curve is equal to the slope of the MR curve.  

### key takeaways on individual supply  

-  firms supply curve is the graph of it's plans  
    -  quantity it plans to sell at each price  
    -  holding all else constant

-  following the core principles:  
    -  keep selling until price = marginal cost  
    -  implies: your supply curve is your marginal cost curve.
    -  implies: a supply curve reveals marginal costs.

### market supply  

-  individual supply 
    -  quantity supplied by a single firm  

Market supply:  
    -  quantity supplied by all firms in the market

market supply curve traces out quantity supplied by all firms in the market at each price.  

### as with demand: four steps to estimate market supply
1.  survey possible suppliers  
    -  ask about quantity supplied at each price
2.  add up the total quantity supplied (at each price)  
3.  scale the quantities supplied by survey respondents, so that they represent the entire market.  
    -  scaling factor = size of the market / size of the survey
4.  plot the market supply curve.  

### market supply curve has the same ingredients as market demand curve  

-  price on vertical axis  
-  quantity on the horizontal axis
-  units on both axes
-  quantity refers to a period of time
-  label the curve
-  can be curved, kinked, or straight line.  

### what do we observe? 

-  law of supply: the quantity of supply is higher when prices are higher.  
    -  looks the same as individual supply curve

-  upward sloping market supply curve reflects:  
    -  intensive margin: the higher the price, the more each firm supplies.
    -  extensive margin: the higher the price, the more sellers enter the market. (lower prices cause loss-making firms to exit the market)  

### what is a market supply curve?  
-  market supply curve is just a set of plans: the quantity of a good that all firms in the market plan to sell, at each price.
-  it is a set of plans "holding other things constant"  
    -  what other things might change?  
    -  apply the interdependence principle.

### increase in supply:  
-  an increase in the supply curve will shift supply to the right.
-  increasing the quantity supplied at each price.
-  decrease in the price at any given quantity  

### decrease in supply:
-  a decrease in the supply curve will shift supply to the left.
-  decreasing the quantity supplied at each price.  
-  increasing the price sellers require to sell at any given quantity.

### five factors shifting market supply curves  

1.  cost of your inputs  
2.  your productivity and technology
3.  other opportunities: price of other outputs  
4.  expectations  
-  these all affect individual supply curves &rarr; so also affect market supply.
5.  number and type of sellers
-  this shifts only the market supply curve, not individual  

### shifter #1: cost of your inputs  
-  interdependence with your suppliers  
-  rise in the price of variable inputs  
    -  labor, raw materials, etc.
    -  causes a rise in marginal costs
    -  yielding a decrease in supply
-  taxes can cause a rising cost of inputs  
-  which input prices?  
    -  variable costs 
       -  wages, raw materials, electricity
    -  not fixed costs!  

### shifter #2: productivity and technology

-  interdependence with technological change  
-  productivity increases  
    -  transform inputs into outputs more efficiently
    -  or same outputs with fewer inputs
-  causing a decline in marginal costs  
-  e.g. a more effective refinery  
    -  can produce same output with fewer workers  
    -  lowering marginal costs  
-  productivity is driven by:  
    -  technology
    -  improved management
    -  research and development  
    -  learning-by-doing  

### shifter #3: price of other outputs  
**substitutes in production**  
-  alternative uses of your productive capacity
-  opportunity cost of producing gasoline: 
    -  is producing more diesel instead  
-  when price of diesel rises:  
    -  it's more profitable to switch from gasoline production to diesel
        -  opportunity cost of producing gasoline rises
    -  increases supply of diesel, decreases supply of gasoline.  

-  don't confuse this with substitutes-in-consumption  

### shifter #3: price of other outputs  
**complements in production**  
-  jointly produced (by products)  
-  asphalt is a byproduct of refining oil  
-  if i produce more gas, i can produce more asphalt.  
-  when the price of asphalt rises, it's more profitable to produce gas.  
    -  i produce more gas AND asphalt

-  don't confuse this with complements-in-consumption  

### shifter #4: expectations and short-run supply

-  for storable goods:  
    -  opportunity cost of selling today is selling tomorrow
    -  selling today is a substitute for selling tomorrow  

-  if the price is expected to be high tomorrow :
    -  keep production high today 
    -  decrease supply today
    -  increase supply tomorrow  

Impies: Production $\neq$ supply  
-  producing and selling are not the same thing  
-  strength of link depends on how storable output is  

### shifter #4: expectations and long run supply  
-  if prices are expected to rise:L  
    -  invest in increasing production capacity  
    -  production today is a complement for production capacity tomorrow  

### shifter #5: number and type of sellers  
-  the number of sellers in the market changes  
    -  doesn't shift individual supply
    -  **does** shift market supply  
-  more sellers increases market supply  

-  this is tricky:  
    -  market supply curve already includes new sellers attracted by higher price (extensive margin)  
-  shift we are referring to here is for reasons unrelated to price: e.g.
    -  loosening of trade restrictions  
    -  demographics altering number of people in the labor market

### Agenda  
-  finish & recap: individual supply curves  
-  market supply curves  


## 2023-09-18 -- Lecture 6: Budget Constraint Analysis  

### Agenda:  
-  budget constrants  
-  consumer choice: maximizing utility subject to budget constraint.  
    -  foud food policies  

### the budget line:  
-  all combinations of goods for which the total amount of money spent is equal to income.  
I = $800, P_f = 10, P_h = 20. 
H = (I/P_h) - (P_f/P_f)F  
H = (40) - (1/2)F  

?note that given this equation, intercept is given by spending all your income on housing.  
And slope of the line is the price ratio.  

### Look at 4 different food policies  
-  base case: Income = $800, P_f = 10, P_h = 20.  

1.  Food bank/soup kitchen  
    -  give first 20 units of food for free  
    -  beyond that P_f = 10  
2.  Food stamps:  
    -  give vouchers that can be redeemed for $200 worth of food.  
    -  P_f = 10 after that.  
3.  Quantity-contingent food coupons  
    -  coupons reduce prce of food to P_f = 5 for the first 40 units of food.  
    -  Beyond that P_f = 10  
4.  Income supplement of $100 if F is less than 20, no change if F is at least 20.  

### Policy 1 + 2: Food Bank and Food Stamps  

The policies result in the same budget constraint, but how are the policies different?  
1.  food bank: time/location (this affects accessiblity.)  
2.  food stamps:  allows for choice of food  
3.  food stamps: creates a market for goods (may be more efficient)  
4.  food stamps: can be (in theory) resold.  
5.  food bank & stamps: same if price of food stays constant, but not if food price changes.  

## Consumer choice  
of all the possible bundles of F and H, which one do I choose?  

Must satisfy two condityions:  
1.  located on the budget line  
2.  must give consumers the most preferred combination of F and H.  

### Two approaches  
1. Graphical: find where indifference curve (IC) is tangent to the budget constraint (BC)  
2.  ADVANCED: Mathematical -- find bundle that satisfies the budget constraint and maximizes utility by setting Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS) = Price Ratio.  

### Characterizing the maximum  
-  Where the budget line and indifference curve are tangent.  
-  recall that slow of the budget line is the price ratio. pf/ph  


### understanding the MRS  

two families face the same budget constraint.  
Family 1 has a stronger preference for housing over food.  
Family 2 has a stronger preference for food over housing.  

The families will be at different poitns along the budget constraint because of their different indifference curves.  

### Overall impact of a price change  
increas in price has the overall impact of shifting consumption bundle away from the good that has become more expensive.

### Effects of price changes  
an increase in price of food has two effects:  
1.  food has gotten relatively more expensive than housing.  
2.  the budget constraint has rotated inward.  

### Effects of price changes  

#### substitution effect  
    -  change in consum ption of a good associated with a change in its relative price, holding utility constant.  

#### income effect  
    -  change in consumption of a good associated with a change in purchasing power, holding relative prices constant.




## 2023-09-13 -- Lecture 5: Consumer Theory  
### Agenda  
-  review shifts in demand  
-  consumer theory: where demand curvges come from  
    -  prefs  
    -  budget constraints  
    -  optimization  

-  monday: using BSs to model policy effects  

### identifying demand shifters (from last time)  
A)  income  
B)  Tastes  
C)  prices of other goods  
D)  expectations  
E)  network and congestion  

### shifts vs. movements along demand curve  
-  market demand curve shows the set of plans for consumers  
    -  how they will react to different prices  

-  a change in price doesn't change your plans  
    -  it will only shift your point on the demand curve.  

### previously: demand curves  
we found that demand depended on:  
-  price  
-  price of subs  
-  income  
-  tastes  
-  etc  

### Previous example  

demand for coffee as a function of price:  

$$
Q_D = 7000 - \frac{7000}{6}P
$$

### Consumer theory  

Theory of consumer behavior:  Description of how consumer allocate incoe among different goods.  

### consumer theory  

Three components:  
1.  consumer preferences  
2.  budget constraints  
3.  consumer choices  

### Applicsation: Food Consumption  

Why do we care?  

Lot of policies designed to alleviate nutritional hardship.  
-  food stamps  
-  WIC  
-  Cash assistance  
-  free school lunches  
  
How can we model the effects of these programs on households food intake?  

### describing consumption  

simplification: only two goods (food and housing)  

market basket (or bundle): list with specific quantities of one or more goods  

To build a theory of consumer behavior, we will ask whethe consumers prefer one market basket to another.  

|Market basket | units of food | units of housing |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| A | 20 | 30 |
| B | 10 | 50 | 
| D | 40 | 20 | 
etc... 

### indivudlas will have preference over these bundles  

four basic assumptions about preferences  
1.  completeness - consumers can compare and rank all possible baskets  
2.  transitivity - consumer rankings are internally consistent  
3.  nonsatiation - consumers are never satisfied. more is always better  
4.  diminishing marginal rate of substitution - less benefit for each additional unit consumed  

> given these assumptions, two ways to represent preferences:  
1.  graphically with indifference curves  
2.  math with utility functions  

### new type of graph:  indifference curves  
quantity of good 1 vs. quantity of good 2  
Each point is a different bundle.  

-  curve representing all combinations of market baskets that provide a consumer with the same level of satisfaction.  
-  consumer is indifferent between points along the curve.  

### Marginal rate of substitution  

MRS = maximum amount of a good that  awconsumer is willing to give up in order to obtain one additional unit of another good -- the trade would keep them just as well off.  

### MRS  
Marginal rate of substitution is the negative os the slope of the indifference curve.  

How to find the slope at different points along the curve:  
-  take the derivative.  

$$
\frac{\Delta Q_x}{\Delta Q_y}
$$
where $Q_x$ is good 1 and $Q_y$ is good 2.  

### income is not unlimited and good are not free  
- budget constraints: constraints that consumers face as a result of limited incomes  
-  budget line: all combinations of goods that a consumer can obtain with a given income.  

Budget Line: $P_FF + P_HH = I$

Ex. I = $800, $P_F$ = 10, $P_H$ = 20  
What is H intercept? 
-  H = 40  
-  F intercept is 80

### the slope of the budget line  

$$
H = \left( \frac{I}{P_H}\right) - \left(\frac{P_F}{P_H} \right) F
$$

-  increases in income are represented as shifht to the right of the budget line.  
<br> 
#### shifts in budget constraints  
-  shift 2: When the price of good 1 increases, price of good 2 stays the same, the intercept of the budget constraint changes (intersects at a lower price for good 1)  
-  shift 3:  change in price of good 2 with no change in price of good 1, the intercept of the budget constraint changes (intersect at a lower price for good 2)
-  change in both prices: reduces the budget constraint for both goods. This is just a change in income (negative), so the budget line shrinks.  





## 2023-09-11 -- Lecture 4: Market Demand  

### Announcements  
-  Lunch discussions w/ Stange - once required  
-  Ch. 2 Achieve due Thursday night  
-  Third problem set: Budget Constraints (not on Achieve)  

### where we've been  
-  individual demand curve simply graphs your plans  
    -  the quantity you plan to buy, at each price  
    -  holding all else constant  

-  following core principles:  
    -  keep buying until: price = marginal benefit  
-  implies: your ind. demand curve is your **marginal benefit curve**.  
    -  demand curve reveals your marginal benefit  

### how is this useful?  
1.  policy analysis  
    -  to find out someone's marginal benefits, simply ovbserve their individual demand curve.  
2.  forceasting the choices others make.  

### is this a realistic way to think about how people make decisions?  
-  core principles guide you to the best buying decisions.  
-  but perhaps people don't follow the core principles.  
  
Answer: People experiment instead!  
-  as they experiment, they settle on the most optimal buying decisions.  
result:  people make choices as if they made the calculations that our theories predict they should make.  

### do people really act this way?  
> is is more useful to evaluate economic models on the accuracy of their empirical predictions than on their assumptions

### three implicatiosn of behavioral econ for public policy  
1.  new policy tools: changing default options, framing, etc  
2.  better predictions about the effects of existing policies: e.g. intertia in retirement decisions, EITC.  
3.  new welfare implications: wedge between policy-makers objective and objective that drives decision-making.  

### from ind. demand to market demand  

### four steps to estimate market demnd  
1.  survey customers  
    -  ask about quantity demanded at each price  
2.  add up the total quantity demanded (at each price)  
3.  scale the quantities demanded by survey respondents, so that the represent the entire market.  
$$
Scaling Factor = \frac{Size of the market}{Size of the Survey}
$$  

4.  Plot the market demand curve.  

### plot the market demand curve   


### What do we observe? 
Law of demand: The quantity demanded is higher when prices are lower.  

Why is the quantity demanded higher when the price is lower?  
1.  intensive margin: the cheaper something is, **the more each customer buys.**  
2.  extensive margin: the cheaper something is, **the more customers you get.**  

-  Can represent market demand (approximately) with an equation:  
    -  $P = Intercept + Slope(Q)$  
Steps:  
-  Find Intercept -- Price where X (Quantity) = 0  
-  Find Slope -- Change in P divided by Change in Q (rise/run): $\frac{6}{7000}$  

> This is the _inverse demand curve_. Regular demand curves are written in terms of Quantity ($Q$).  

### What is a market demand curve?  
-  demand curve is just a set of plans.  
-  it is a set of plans "holding other things constant"  
-  what are these "other things" that might change?  
    -  apply the interdependences principle  

### Six factors shifting market demand curves  

-  income  
-  tastes  
-  prices/characteristics of other goods  
-  expectations  
-  network and congestions effects  
    -  all of the above affect ind. demand curves &rarr; so also affect market demand.  
-  the number and type of buyers  
    -  changes the scaling factor in moving from ind. to market demand curves.  

### Increase in Demand  
-  An increase in the demand curve will **shift** demand to the right.
-  this increases the quantity demanded at each price.   

### decrease in demand  
-  a decrease in the demand curve will **shift** demand to the left.  
-  this decreases the quantity demanded at each price.  

### shifter #1: Income  
-  normal good: higher income causes an increase in demand for normal goods.  
-  inferior good: higher income causes a decrease in demand for inferior goods.  

> when my income is higher, i take more taxis (normal) and fewer buses (inferior).  

Other examples of inferior goods:  
-  used cars (maybe)  
-  ramen  

### shifter #2: changing tastes shift demand  
-  increased environmental awareness has reduced demand for SUVs.  
-  tastes and styles can change.  

### shifter #3: price of other goods  
-  substitute goods  
    -  replace each other  
    -  demand increases when the price of substitute good rises.  

-  complementary goods  
    -  goods that go together  
    -  demand decreases when the price of complementary goods rises.  

> Ex. When the prices of a taxi falls, i take the bus less (substitute for taxis)  

### shifter #4 other peoples buying decisions  
-  network effects  
    -  when a good becomes more useful because other people use it.  
    -  social media  
-  congestion effects  
    -  when a good becomes less useful because other poeple use it.  
    -  increased use by othes will decrease demand.  

### shifter #6: number and type of buyers  
-  the ind. in the market are changing.  
    -  doesn't shift ind. demand.  
    -  might change market demand.

## 2023-09-06 -- Lecture 3: Individual Demand

### Announcements: 
-    Office hours:  
    -  Kevin: Tues 9-10 (5130 Weill), 4:30 - 5:30 (zoom)  
    -  Amy & Michael: see sign up sheet  
- Achieve/book: Issues 
- Clickers - will start using this week 
- Others? 

### Review: Where we have been  
> Cost-Benefit Principle: "s Benefit >= Cost?"  
> Opportunity Cost Principle: "Or what?"  
> Marginal Principle: "One more?"  
> Interdependence Principle: "What else?"  

### Roadmap  
#### Today:  
-  Discover the shape of individual demand curves  
-  Demand curves come from the Rational Rule. 
    - Applytin the four core principlaes  

#### Next Class:  
-  Use the individual demand curve to construct market demand.  
- Understand how the changing market ocnditions shift the demand curve.  

### What is an individual demand curve?  
- An individual demand curve is just a set of plans.  
  -  The quantity someone plans to buy, dependin gon the price.  
- It is the set of plans **"holding other things constant."**  
   - If other things change &rarr; your plans will change! &rarr; your demand curve will change.  
   -  What other things might change your plans for how many cupos of coffee to buy?  

### Examples of Demand Curves in Policy  
-   Years of postsecondary study of number of college courses taken as a function of the price (tuition minus aid)  
-   Labor demand &larr; (as a function of) wages  
-   Housing demand &larr; Prices  
-   Water &larr; Price (Resource use)  

###### (iClicker Questions asked  in Class)  
-   Quantity demanded for coffee at varying prices.  
-   How to label the supply and demand curves (x and y axes)  

### Graphing conventions  
-   Price on the vertical axis  
-   Quantity on the x-axis.  
-   Units on both axes.  
-   Quantity refers to a period of time.  
-   Label the curve.  
-   Demand curve can be kinked, curved, or straight line.  

### What do we observe?  
-   Downward sloping demand curves  
   -  The lower the price, the higher in the quantity demanded.
   -  The cheaper something is, the more you buy.  
-   The law of demand: **The quantity demanded is higher when prices are lower**  

### Why do we care about the demand curve for gas?  
-   Will do a deep dive into demand curve for gas.  
-   Why is this useful?  
    -  Understanding the demand for gas can help us design policy to reduce/increase demand for gas/other goods.  

### How firms learn about individual demand:  
-   A survey of individual's demand for gasoline.  
-   Ask customers about expected purchases per week at various prices.  

> This is all empirics (or descriptive data), what is the theory?  

### Deciding What Quantity to Buy  
** How much gas shouold I buy? (at a given price)  
-   This is a "How many" question &rarr; Apply the **marginal principle**.  
    -  Should I buy one more gallon of gas?  
-   Use the **cost-benefit principle**  
   -  Buy one more gallon if:  
   >  The benefit of one more gallon of gas **is at least as large as** the cost of one more gallon of gas.  

-   Buy if marginal benefit is >= marginal cost of one additional gallon.  
  
### Rational Rule for Buyers:  
**Rational Rule for Buyers:** 
-   Buy more of an item if it's marginal benefit is greater than (or equal to) the price. 

Following this rule means: 

#### Keep buying until: Price = Marginal Benefit.  
(This is the rational rule, applied to buyers)  

**The Theory of Demand is the Theory of Marginal Benefits**

### Exercise: How much will Someone Benefit from policy that reduces gas price from $3 to $2.  

-   When price == $3, he will consume 3 gallons of gas.  

When the price is reduced to $2, he will receive an additional $3.50 of benefit from the extra gas he will purchase.
