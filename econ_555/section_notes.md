### individual demand  
#### The individual demand curve  
-  an individual demand curve is:  
    -  a set of plancs  
    -  based on a point in time  
    -  for a defined market  
    -  holding other things constant  

_"At each price, how many navel oranges am I willing to buy this week?"_  

#### what shapes an individual demand curve?  
-  demand is downward sloping  
    -  law of demand; the quantity demanded is higher when prices are lower.  
    -  _"What quantity will I buy at each price?"_  
-  diminishing marginal benefit: each additional item yields a smaller marginal benefit than the last one.  
    -  _"what price am i willing to pay for each quantity?"_

#### demand is all about marginal benefits  
-  if our future plans follow **the rational rule for buyers**, this means that:  
> Individual Demand Curve = Marginal Benefit Curve  

e.g. gallons of gas @ $3:  

| gallons of gas | marginal benefit | marginal cost | net benefit | 
|---|---|---|---| 
| 1 | 5 | 3 | 2 | 
| 2 | 4 | 3 | 1 | 
| 3 | 3 | 3 | 0 | 
|total benefit | | |3  | 


gallons of gas @ $2:  
| gallons of gas | marginal benefit | marginal cost | net benefit | 
|---|---|---|---| 
| 1 | 5 | 2 | 3 | 
| 2 | 4 | 2 | 2 | 
| 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 
| 4 | 2.5 | 2 | 0.5 | 
| 5 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 
| total benefit |  |  | 6.5 |
