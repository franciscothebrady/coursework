### Housekeeping

- problem #1 due 2/3

### 4 types of validity

1. internal validity: does a study provide evidence that a causal relationship exists between an independent variable and a dependent variable?
2. statistical conclusion validity: were the appropriate statistical methods used to assess whether a relationship exists?
3. construct validity: does the measurement tool accurately capture the theoretical concept it is intended to measure.
4. external validity: do the inferences drawn from the study sample apply to a broader population or other target populations?

### Paper topic and question

- up to 2 pages
- short description of topics and rationale for why this topic is important for public policy
- 3 different research questions that you want to answer
- dataset you plan to use
- plan for obtaining data within reasonable timeline

### Independent Research Paper

- first and most difficult part is usually ideation
- combining:
    - tools to answer questions
    - knowledge about topics important to public policy
- in order to come up with research questions that generate testable hypothesis that can be answered with data
- also needs to be feasible in one semester

### By April 15th (10 weeks)

- come up with a policy area
- competent knowledge about existing literature
- research questions and testable hypothesis
- obtain dataset
- conduct an analysis
- be able to communicate your results

### Literature Review

- educate yourself on a topic:
    - what data do people use
    - what research designs do people use
    - what outcomes do people focus on. how do they measure them.
    - what sources of bias are people worried about.

- to motivate your research:
    - other researchers have looked at X, but there is no good answer to this other important question which you can address.

### How do you find relevant literature

- google scholar
- try different kewords
- journal of econ perspectives, journal of econ. literature useful for broad non-technical overviews.
- do NOT read every paper you find
    - read titles to see if they're relevant
    - if relevant, read abstract, if not move on
    - read intro to get most information you need
    - skim other parts of papers as needed

- once you've read the paper:
    - trace backwards: look through references for relevant papers
    - trace forwards: look for subsequent papers that cite the paper
- take notes and write up what you find
    1. seek common themes that tie papers together
    2. do they use the same data/focus on same outcomes
    3. do the authors agree with in their conclusions
    4. do they agree with methodology

### Research Questions

Three tasks of data science (hernan et al., 2019)
1. description
2. prediction
3. causal inference

use your understanding of the literature to form research questions.

start with the "big question" that you seek to answer:
- what is relationship between ethnicity and income
- how does social class affect individual health
- why do police officers use force

### translate your research question into hypotheses

we answer the research question with hypotheses:
H1: more de-escalation training reduces police use-of-force
H2: higher stress levels increase the likelihood of police 
H3: suspects who physically resist arrest are more likely to face police force
H4: police officers working longer shifts use force more frequently
H5: poilce use force more often in high-crime areas, regardless of suspect behavior

note: your hypotheses cannot be proven right
the scientific method is one of falsification

### Falsification Principle

developed by karl popper to distinguish science form pseudoscience.

- a theory is scientific if it can be tested and potentially proven false
- science progresses by falsification, not by confirming evidence

Example: "All swans are white"
- seeing 100 white swans does not prove it right
- finding 1 black swan proves it wrong

### Falsifiable v. non-falsifiable theories

scientific theories make precise predictions and can be tested and falsified.

Example:
1. higher levels of inequality reduce long-term econ growth
2. higher wealth concentration reduces social mobility

pseudoscience cannot be tested in a way that can prove them false:
examples:
1. capitalism inherently leads to unjust levels of inequality
2. raising taxes on the rich is always fair
3. econ. inequality is a threat to democracy

### positive v. normative questions

positive:
- objective, fact-based
- can be tested with data 
- describe what **is** rather than what should be

normative:
- subjective and opinion based
- cannot be tested -- depend on values and beliefs
- describe what **ought to be**
