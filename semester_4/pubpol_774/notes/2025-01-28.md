## Generalizability and External Validity

### Recap: iThrive

- Workplace wellness program
- RCT on health spending and wellness outcomes

- iThrive estimates differed from correlational evidence

#### Why were the results different

Estimate = Estimand + Bias + Noise

- discrepancy could be due to bias or Noise
- bias, error, selection bias can be eliminated through randomization

### Practical issues of measurement 

*Construct Validity*: the extent to which a measurement tool accurately captures the theoretical concept it is intended to measure.

### 3 types of Validity

Internal: extent to which a study provides evidence that a causal relationship exists

statistical conclusion validity: extent to which appropriate statistical methods were used to assess whether a relationship exists

and construct Validity

### external validity 

Related to some different concepts:
- replicability
- generalizability 
- transportability 
- scalability

### threats to external validity

1. type 12 errors and publication Bias
2. representativeness of the sample
3. representativeness of the situation
4. spillovers
5. fidelity

### type I errors and publication bias 

problems that could contribute to false positives:
- multiple hypothesis testing
- not clustering standard errors
- low power

publication bias:
- norms in science of confidence at 90 or 95 confidence level
- p < 0.10*, p< 0.05**, p>0.01***
- journals tend to favor studies that reject the null hypothesis

### representativeness of the sample

- selected sample is one that isn't drawn at random from population of interest.
- selected sample may not be representative of the target pop.
- relationships that hold in selected sample may not hold in broader population.

example: college admissions
- there may be a relationship between GRE and success, but is not compared to non-enrolled students.

### external overlap

- generalizability and transportability requires *external overlap*
- at least some of the subjects in the experiment share observable characteristics with the larger population.

### Reweighting

One approach to address this is to reweight the sample:

$$
w_i = \frac{Pr_{target}(X_i = x)}{Pr_{sample}(X_i = x)}
$$

- If the target population is equal to the sample, give weight of 1
- If the target population is less likley to be in the sample, give weight larger than 1
- If the target population is more likely to be in the sample, give weight less than 1.

### Advantages/Limitations

Pro:
- adjusts for observed differences
- simple to implement
- can help generalize findings

Con:
- assume selection into the study on observables
- requires overlap in covariate distributions across populations
- can be difficult if you want to reweight on many variables at the same time.

### Selection on **unobservables**

self selection into experiments
- people choose whether to participate
- recruitment methods can affect estimates

site selection bias:
- partners choose who to work with based on their expected benefits

### Selection into experiments

Participation bias: The treatment estimate based on the probability of not being a participant in the experiment.

Often, the treatment effect for the participants is higher for those who opt into participation. 
- This is because people optimize for their own situation

### selection into experiments, pt.2

we can compute participation bias as:
$$
ATE_{p_i = 1} - ATE_{p_i = 0} = P[P_i = 0](ATE_{p_i = 1} - ATE_{p_i = 0})
$$

People will be more likely to participate in the experiment if:
1. they are more likely to benefit from the experimen.
2. they have a worse outside option
3. they have better control outcomes
4. participation incentives are higher 
5. participation costs are lower.

### representativeness of the situation

niederle and vesterland 2008
- competitive wage schemes and gender

### SUTVA

identifying a causal effect requires specifying potential outcomes and the assignment mechanism:

$$
Y_i = Y_{1t}T_i + Y_{0i}(1 - T_i)
$$

- We assume any units potential outcomes **do not vary** with the treatments assigned to or undertaken by **any** other unit.  
- but an individuals outcome can depend on the treatmenty status or outcome of ones peers
- in this case, changing the scale of an intervention will change the treatment effect.
