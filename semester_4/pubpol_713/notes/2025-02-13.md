## 2025-02-13: Mixed Methods

### Why it matters: Mixed methods in policy

- justification for policy adoptoin: evidence of "what works"
- historically, experimental or quasi-ecxperimental evidence is the "gold standard"
- OMB: RCTs must be used in:
    - social, ed, econ, and similar programs aimed at improving life outcomes for individuals.

IES: Institute for Education Sciences -- Government funding arm for education studies (like NIH for Ed)

- IES: RCTs and quasi-experimental methods receive federal funding

### Flipping the Paradigm: Deductive v. Inductive

Deductive:
- start with defined hypothesis
- testing a known concept/variables
- data collection before analysis
- can't change hypothesis/data plan

Inductive:
- no hypothesis, a priori assumptions
- developing a new concept/discovering new variables
- data collection iteratively with analysis
- refine ideas as you go

### How to combine methods?

- mixed v. multiple methods
- sequential:
    - initial phase uses one method
    - second phase uses different method
    - explanatory: #1 quant, #2 qual
    - exploratory: #1 qual, #2 quant
- concurrent
    - data collection occurs in parallel
    - nested: one method is dominant, the other is embedded within.
    - triangulated: two methos are simultaneously used to corroborate each other / address weaknesses.
- fully integrated:
    - methods are intertwined by design
    - quant/qual happen at the same time
    - one informs the other

Ex. Started project looking at impact of TIP scholarship. After interviews found that take-up was a real challenge, so updated priors and plan to investigate barriers to take-up.
