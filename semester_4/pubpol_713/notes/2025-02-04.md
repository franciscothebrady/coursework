### Loans

three big questions:
1. does expanding loan access increase enrollment and attainment?
2. consequences of debt v.s. other forms of financing?
3. how to improve repayment / reduce default?
(4. who benefits from debt forgiveness?)


### US Loan Market
- Federal (Direct, PLUS)
    - Gov sets rates, eligibility, disbursement
        - private banks used to do this until 2009
    - private sector now limited to servicing existing loans
        - increased scrutiny from CFPB
- Private
    - unsecured consumer loans
    - less attractive terms than federal loans

### Federal Loan Programs

- Direct Loans (also called Stafford)
    - Largest program
    - no credit check 
    - interest rate fixed
    - for subsidized loans, interest is paid by govt while enrolled
    - capped per year and cumulative

- Parent PLUS
    - credit check 
    - payments begin immediately
    - higher interest than direct, no loan forgiveness

- Grad PLUS
    - credit check
    - enrolled in grad programs
    - can borrow up to full cost of attendance minus other aid
