### Announcements

PS1 Next Week

### Hasting, Neilson, Zimmerman (2014)

- Admissions cutoffs for 1000 different posecondary programs in Chile --> 1000 RD estimates

- Interpretation is the challenge -- counterfactual differs for each program

Outcome Model
$$
Y_{ip} = \mu_{i} + \Theta_p + \theta_{ip} + \omega_{ip}
$$

- Solution: Use instrument for admission to each program simultaneously

### Remaining Questions

- College selectivity and college major really matter
    - Why
    - What are the mechanisms

- Access to job networks
- Skills:
    - specialization v. generality
    - how different skills are rewarded in the market
- human capital vs. signaling expectations
- etc

- Accountability in the presence of heterogeneity

### Cost-Benefits

Part of what Stange did at Dept of Education:  

- Add up all benefits, costs, and transfers
- earnings gains are the biggest benefit (historically left unqualified)
- what would the earnings be if you shifted a bunch of students from failing programs (low earnings) to non-failing programs (high earnings)

### HC v. Signal

- Human Capital Model
    - education makes people more productive
    - more productive people earn higher wages
    - thus education --> increases wages

- Signaling model
    - some people are inherently more productive than others 
    - edsucation is less costly (less effort) for more productive people
    - thus more productive will get more education 
    - employers can't tell who is more productive
    - employers use education as a signal of productivity 

### Why do we care

- implications of HC v. Signaling

One approach:
- Martorell and Clark, 2014: Look at students who barely pass/fail HS exit exams
    - find no difference in earnings
    - good evidence for human capital model


### Arteaga 

- policy change decreased # of credits required for Econ and Biz degree by 20% and 14%

- compared earnings outcomes from pre- and post-reform students graduating from university with graduates from other top 10 universities.

- main strategy: difference-in-difference approach

- result: -13% (biz) and -16% lower earnings post-reform

### Results

- Pre-trends:
    - need to ensure that two groups (treatment affected by policy and control) are both following the same trajectory over time before the policy change.

### Estimation

$$
ln wage_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Andes_i * post_t + \beta_2 Andes_i + \beta_3 Post_i + \beta_4 experience_{i,t} + \epsilon_{it}
$$

Where:
- Main coefficient: $Andes_i * post_t$, which is the change in outcome for treatment group relative to control after the policy change.

### Main threats to identification



### Key Assumption of DiD

The outcome change in the control group provides a good approximation of the outcoem change the treatment group would have experienced in the absence of the policy

In practice you should check:
- outcomes are trending similarly for treated and control before the policy change
- no other policy changes happened at the same time (to either treatment or control)
- policy didn't differentially alter the sample composition

### Inference

Main table uses "standard errors clustered at the individual level"
- why cluster at the individual level?
- standard cluster robust standard errors requires sufficiently large number of clusters and individuals within clusters.

note: generally want to cluster at the level of treatment

- unlikely to hold in this context with one treatment group
    - implement a variant of fisher's permutation or randomization test
    - estimate a treatment "effect" for every non-treated school and placebo year
    - many estimates of the "effect" where there should not be one.
    - this tells you the distribution of estimates under the null of no effect
    - compare the actual treatment effect estimate for the real treated school (Andes) to those estimates.
- an alternative to various cluster bootstrapping schemes

### Mechanisms

- based on interviews:
    - changes in hiring patterns pre- and post
