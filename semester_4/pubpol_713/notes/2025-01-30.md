### Announcements 

For monday:
- put together 2 discussant slides 
- problem set

### Coding basics

- add comments throughout
- specific for the assignment:
    - qqt1 missing --> not preselected
    - table 4: column 1 is 2SLS and column 2 is just OLS
    - table 4: column 1 point estimate in stata is off by 0.001

### Merit Aid

- Eligibility depends on academic achievement 
- state merit aid programs vary in reach and generosity
    - usually tied to HS GPA or SAT/ACT scores or both
    - usually require GPA requirement for renewal 

### Cohodes, Goodman (2014)

- Looks at Massachusetts (Adams scholarship)
- only for in-state public colleges
- eligibility determined by english and math scores (relative to district)
- covered tuition only (not fees or room/board)

Note: in general this program was not very generous

### Institutions

- turns out relative to public state colleges, colleges that aren't eligible for this scholarship are much better funded and higher quality.

### What is college quality

- cohodes, goodman use:
    - 4-year grad rates
    - instructional spending
    - spending per student
    - SAT math 75th percentile

take variables and put them into a Principal Component Analysis:
- essentially creates a weighted average for all of the variables, where weights are determined by the correlations between variables.
- explains 64% of the variation
- standardized to mean 0, standard deviation of 1

### Eligibility

- cutoff is constructed from 3 components:
    - MUST score advanced (>260) on at least one portion of MCAS exam
    - MUST score proficient on the other portion of the exam
    - MUST have Total MCAS score fall in the top 25% of the scores in your district

Multi-dimensional RD:
- collapse the discontinuity into a single dimenasion by defininf for each student the distance of their math score from the minimum math score that defines eligibility, giver their district and ELA score.
- horizontal distance between the point defined by each student's pair of test scores and the line defining eligibility threshold in their school district.

$$
Y_ijt = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Adamsn_ijt + \beta_2 Gap_ijt  + \beta_3 Gap_ijt \times Adams_ijt + \epsilon_ijt
$$

- Where $Adams_ijt$ = 1 if $Gap_ijt \geq 0$

### Implementation

- Use local linear regression with triangular kernel (which gives more weight to observations closer to the threshold, as opposed to uniform kernel)
- Compute optimal bandwidths, range from 10 - 15, settle on using 12.

### Initial Results

- ~4.8% increase in immediate enrollment
- ~3% increase enroll within 2 years
- no effect on 6-year grad rate

### Main results

- increased enrollment at eligible colleges (6.9%)
- shift from non-adams scholarship eligible 4-year colleges

Essentially, students were going to out-of-state, private colleges, and shift into public 4-year.

- positive graduated in 6 years from adams-eligible colleges
- reduces non-eligible private colleges
- overall reduction of 6-year graduation rate for those enrolled in any college (-2.5%)
 

### General comments 

- opportuntiy to use admin data
- need to know institutional features 
- exactly what is estimated and how it relates to other policy parameters of interes -- varies by study
    - can be hard to get effect of (grant program v. not)
    - usually get the effect of moving to eligibility threshold by a little bit
- ITT: effect on enrollment or completion easier than TOT estimates.
