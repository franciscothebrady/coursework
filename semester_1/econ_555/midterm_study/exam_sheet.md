#### Elasticity  
Elasticity of demand: change in quantity demanded / change in price
$$\frac{\frac{\Q_2 - Q_1}{(Q_2 + Q_1) / 2}}{\frac{P_2 - P_1}{(P_2 + P_1) / 2}}$$  
Cross Price Elasticity: change in quantity demanded of good 1 / change in price of good 2  
Elasticity of supply: change in quantity supplied / change in price  
Income Elasticity of Demand: change in quantity demanded / change in income  

#### Equilibrium  
Equilibrium: where supply and demand intersect
Surplus: when quantity supplied is greater than quantity demanded
Shortage: when quantity demanded is greater than quantity supplied
