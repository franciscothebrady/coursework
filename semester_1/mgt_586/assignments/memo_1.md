Introduction: In response to one of the deadliest years on record for police killings[^1] in the United States, Michigan state representative Lorenzo Brady has proposed the creation of a database to track police use of force, managed by a new division of Law Enforcement Accountability within the Department of the Attorney General.
The division would collect, verify, and publish a regular Use of Force and Rankings (UOFR) report, comparing police departments across the state by the number of incidents each year along with demographic data on use of force.
The report would also include a section identifying officers with higher than average use-of-force incidents.
This memo reviews the proposed legislation, evaluates strengths and weaknesses, and provides some recommendations for improvements.
Context: The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) collects data on police use of force, but has only done so since 2019, and participation in their reporting program is voluntary.
The best data has been maintained by journalists and academics.
The Washington Post has kept a publicly accessible database on fatal police incidents since 2015, after the killing of Michael Brown.
Other journalist-led projects include Mapping Police Violence, and Fatal Encounters.
These projects collect data by sourcing local reporting on the police departments involved, as well as basic demographic data.
These sources are invaluable for researchers and journalists, but are based on news reporting only, and are sometimes slow to update with complete information.
Recently, renewed activism around police accountability in the wake of the 2020 murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, has prompted calls for legislation, including the one from state Rep. Brady.

The Brennan Center for Justice report that at least 30 states have passed legislation mandating changes to police use of force standards since 2020[^2].
In Michigan, many police departments voluntarily submit their data on use of force reports, although the names of officers involved are excluded.
Strengths: The legislation proposes establishing a statewide database of violent police incidents, creating a new division to monitor compliance, collect data and publish frequent analysis along with the ranking of departments.\
State Rep. Brady, who is sponsoring the legislation, has compared the proposal to rankings published in the medical fields of hospitals and doctors involved in patient deaths, arguing these led to improvements in doctor and hospital quality, highlighting trends in patient care that were not observable before, and could do the same for police departments.
In the same way, the UOFR Report could help departments identify officers in need of additional training and support.
Open access to the use of force incident data would allow journalists and researchers access to a verified, government-sponsored source of information, and would increase public trust in police departments.
The UOFR report has the potential to open a dialogue in communities where the local police departments are more poorly ranked.
Having the data to hold informed conversations about reforming police tactics when interacting with the communities they serve can be an effective tool when advocating for changes in department policies.
The legislation also includes provisions that tie compliance to access to state funding for local departments.
In response, the Michigan Association of Police Organizations has come out against the proposal.
Weaknesses: The current legislation includes a mandate to report and rank departments as well as disclose poorly ranked officers.
While the aim of the publication would be to identify problematic trends in departments, the "name and shame" aspect of the UOFR could face vigorous pushback from police unions, and could even lead to noncompliance.
A possible amendment is discussed in the next section.
Another aspect of the proposal that could draw criticism is the focus exclusively on physical police violence, toignoring other behaviors that compromise community trust.
Recent research by University of Michigan researcher Dr. Lisa Fedina and coauthers associates other forms of police violence (sexual, psychological, or neglectful acts) with increased distress and attempted suicides in local communities[^3]
. Recommendations: The most salient criticism revolves around the proposed "name and shame" step of including high incident police officers in the UOFR report
. This could be addressed by modifying the proposal to exclude officer names and instead focus only on the poorly ranked departments
. Coupling compliance with access to additional state funding could encourage departments to embrace the proposal

This legislation proposes, establishing a new database on police violence, overseen by the Office of the Attorney General, and the publication of a use of force report and ranking.
The legislation could be strengthened by excluding officer names, adopting funding incentives for compliance, and enlarging its scope to include other forms of police violence.
