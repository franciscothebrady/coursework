## recap

we've spent the last few weeks talking about the oversight landscape of local policing 

starting with civilian oversight, we've started talking about different ways to involve greater public oversight into policing

- limited police oversight from civilian review board model
- broader policy and practice context of an auditor/inspector general model 

Last few weeks won't focus on specific institutional models of oversight, but focus more on philosophical perspectives: 
- democratic policing
- community policing

focus of today:
how policing can be more fair and democratic than it is today

## democratic policing 

term introduced by barry friedman
- he was especially concerned about new surveillance technology that have been introduced into policing without any oversight (or disclosure)

### general idea 
democratic policing 

what does it mean? 
- transparency -- members of the public should be able to see what the police are doing 
- public input into the process of whether and what types of models, tools, and tactics the police should adopt
- police need to develop practices for soliciting public input into their work -- need better models for community outreach and engagement over policymaking 
- front-end accountability -- police should develop policies with public input, accountability should be up front, and not in the back-end, which is just about punishment for misconduct. 


### tensions 
- rules that the court sets out ot constrain policing practices, but they are a floor. 
- beyond that the community has a legitimate authority to set priorities for police. 

### in what sense is the status quo in policing not democratic?
- lots of decisions in police departments are made without public input, police chiefs make decisions about what types of information to disclose 

### what other issues is this likely to raise?
