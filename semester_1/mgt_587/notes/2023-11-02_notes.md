## mechanisms of legal oversight
1. criminal procedure remedies 
- especially excluding illegaly obtained evidence
2. criminal prosecution of officers 
- e.g. prosecution of derek chauvin
3. lawsuits seeking money damages 
- e.g. suit against BPD for Freddie Gray
4. lawsuits seeking injunctions 
- e.g. Floyd v. New York stop and frisk case 

- common thread among all of these mechanisms: focus on individual misconduct and not on systemic issues  
    -  hope is that individual sanctions will have systemic effects 
    -  focus on individuals is too limited 

## lawsuits seeking injunction  

- different because they are seeking to prove a pattern or practice of misconduct and seek to change the way the police department operates.
- they are not focused on individual misconduct
    -  they are relatively infrequent, because they are hard to prove  

> federal investigations (and subsequent consent decrees) are designed as a form of injunctive relief
-  it's possible for the DOJ to take action against a police departments to force systemic changes 
-  this was allowed as a result of the 1994 crime bill: section 14141
    -  introduced by crongressional black caucus (cbc) after rodney king beating in LA
    -  give DOJ authority to investigate police departments for a pattern or practice of unconstitutional policing

## DOJ investigations
- start with complaints to doj 
    - PD is engaged in a pattern or practice of constitutional violations 
    -  doj sends lawyers and police practice experts to investigate
    -  conduct interviews, review documents, observe police practices
    -  goal is to investigate if unconstitutional conduct exists that is more than just a couple of instances of misconduct, **it is a pattern or practice**.  
-  if there is a pattern found:
    -  doj issues a findings letter
    -  doj and city negotiate a consent decree
    -  might mandate new policies: 
        -  e.g. use of force, stop and frisk, etc.
    -  might mandate new training:
        -  e.g. de-escalation, implicit bias, etc.
    -  might mandate new data collection
    -  might mandate new oversight groups 
    -  might mandate new equipment: e.g. body cameras 
-  finally, install a monitor to ensure that a city PD is following the decree
    -  this can get expensive!
    -  issue quarterly update reports on how the PD is abiding by the decree 

### Example of Newark PD 

#### how does doj decide to investigate a PD?
- complaint from aclu 2010
- described hundreds of complaints of misconduct
- aclu had filed multiple suits and tried other methods 
- doj agreed and sent investigators 

#### finding report, 2014 
- stops and arrets 
- disparate impact by race 
- use of force
- big focus: stop and frisk 
- 75% of stops were unconstitutional
- found officers did not understand the law 
- training implied that stops could be made in high crime areas as the sole justification for stops 
- supervision was flawed: did not review or flag unconstitutional stops

#### consent decree, 2016
- doj found pattern or practice of constitutional violations 
- doj and city negotiated a consent decree with the department to address problems 
- wrt stop and frisk:
    - have to enact policies and enforce policies that require legal justification for all stops 
    - NPD has to improve training
    - supervisors need to review stops and take action when stops are not justified
- how can we judge follow through?
    - court appoints an independent monitor 
    - usually issues quarterly reports
