## 2023-11-14 notes 

## media 

podcast -- "we regret to inform you" 
-- about how when police kill a person, they go to the family's house and interview the family about the person at length **before** notifying them that they were killed by police. 
-- this is a practice that is endorsed by police and for-profit law enforcement training and policy agencies (such as lexipol).
-- this is a good example of how good, factual but aggressive journalism and media is able to uncover and the role they are able to play in the public interest around police reform. 

## memo
- what are teh choices the doj can make to make the practice of investigations the best it can be. 
- centrally about the federal govt's role, he chose that topic because it lets you talk about all the other actors involved in oversight as well: 
-- useful to consider the gaps by legal oversight, local political oversight, etc 
-- you should mention many of the oversight actors 

## from last time: unions 

review from thursday:
- basic theme: police unions are often viewed as obstacles to reform. 
- Fisk and Richardson challenge this view
    - labor law gives unions power over specific things, especially discipline
    - this can be an obstacle to some kinds of reforms 
    - but discipline is not everything on the reform agenda.
    - union doesn't have authority to block other kinds of reforms
    - instead focus on other important aspects of reform where the union can be an ally
    - or areas where union does not actually have the authority to block reforms  
- Fisk and Richardson argue that there may be more overlap between union interests and the aims of reformers than it seems at first
