## Background

The University of Michigan offers numerous resources that can help you and other students in their
well-being journeys. Below is a multiline string that provides a select group of U-M well-being
resources available to all students.

```python
wellbeing_resources = (
    "Dean of Students Office|734-764-7420, "
    "Sweetland Center for Writing|734-764-0429, "
    "Office of the Ombuds|734-763-3545, "
    "Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)|734-764-8312, "
    "Wolverine Wellness|, "
    "Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Center (SAPAC)|734-764-7771, "
    "Trotter Multicultural Center|734-763-3670, "
    "Spectrum Center|734-763-4186, "
    "Maize and Blue Cupboard (MBC)|734-936-2794, "
    "Ginsberg Center for Community Service Learning|734-763-3548"

We hope this assignment will increase your awareness of the numerous resources that UMich offers for
your benefit as listed in the SI 506 [Syllabus](https://si506.org/syllabus/) (see Section 8.0).

## 1.0 Problem 01 (25 Points)

**Task:** Create a master list of all wellbeing resources, then create sublists for different
categories of resources.

1. You have been provided with a variable containing a single string expressed across multiple lines
   (a multiline string) named `wellbeing_resources`. Review each resource and note which character(s)
   delineate (separate) each resource. Call the appropriate string method to return a list of resource
   elements. Assign the return value of the string method to the variable `resources`, and display
   its contents.

2. Assign the first three elements of the list named `resources` to a new variable named `academic`
   using list slicing.

   :exclamation: You are limited to using a single statement that includes a slicing expression.

3. Assign the fourth and fifth elements of the list `resources` to a new list variable named
   `health` using list slicing.

   :exclamation: You are limited to using a single statement that includes a slicing expression.

4. Assign the sixth, seventh, and eighth elements of the list `resources` to a new list variable
   named `marginalized_comm` using list slicing and negative index values.

   :exclamation: You are limited to using a single statement that slices the list using negative index
   values.

5. Assign the last two elements of the list `resources` to a new list variable named `community`
   using list slicing and negative indexing.

   :exclamation: You are limited to using a single statement that slices the list using negative index
   values.

## 2.0 Problem 02 (25 Points)

**Task:** Update some of your resource sublists with additional resources using various list
methods.

1. Call the appropriate `list` method to extend the list `health` (which you created in 1.3) with the list
   `addl_health_resources`.

   :exclamation: The value assigned to `health` _must_ match the list `health_check` (see Setup Code)
   after calling the list method. Uncomment the associated `assert` statement to confirm the variable
   matches the expected value.

2. Call the appropriate `list` method to add `embedded_caps` as the last element of the `health` list.

3. Call the appropriate `list` method to insert `mesa` as the third element of the `marginalized_comm` list
   (which you created in 1.4).

4. Using list indexing and string concatenation, mutate the list `addl_academic_resources` by
   concatenating _each_ element with the respective phone numbers in `addl_academic_resource_numbers`.

   :exclamation: The value assigned to `addl_academic_resources` _must_ match the list `addl_academic_resources_check` (see Setup Code) after concatenating the corresponding strings. Uncomment the associated `assert` statement to confirm the variable matches the expected value.

5. Call the appropriate `list` method to extend the list `academic` (which you created in 1.2) with `addl_academic_resources`.

   :exclamation: The value assigned to `academic` _must_ match the list `academic_check` (see Setup Code). Uncomment
   the associated `assert` statement to confirm the variable matches the expected value.

## 3.0 Problem 03 (15 Points)

**Task:** Re-sort some of your resource sublists using various list methods. Create an additional
list with resources from the `health` sublist.

1. Use the appropriate list method to _reverse_ the order of the list `marginalized_comm` elements.

2. Use the appropriate list method to sort the order of the list `health` elements in _ascending_
   alphanumeric order.

3. Use the appropriate list method to sort the order of `academic` elements in _descending_
   alphanumeric order.

   :bulb: Be sure to also specify the parameter `reverse` in the relevant list method
   as `True` `(reverse=True)`.

4. Using the appropriate list method, return the index value of
   `UMSI Embedded CAPS Psychologist|Ashley Evearitt` in `health`. Assign the index value to the
   variable `umsi_caps`.

5. Slice `UMSI Embedded CAPS Psychologist|Ashley Evearitt` and `University Health Service (UHS)|734-764-8320`
   from `health` using _positive index values_. You _must_ use the variable `umsi_caps` in your
   slicing expression. Assign the new list to a variable named `student_focused_health_resources`.

   :exclamation: You are limited to using a single statement that utilizes the variable `umsi_caps`
   in your slicing expression.

## 4.0 Problem 04 (10 Points)

**Task:** Using the built-in functions `str.split()` and `str.join()` to create tuples and
variables.

1. Retrieve the third element from the list `academic` and then convert it into a two-item tuple with the
   name as the first item and the phone number as the second. Next, assign this tuple to a variable
   named `third_academic_element`.
   Then uncomment the `assert` statement to confirm the variable matches the expected value.

2. Retrieve the second to last element from the list `health` using _negative index values_ and
   convert it into a two-item tuple with the name as the first item and the phone number as the
   second. Next, assign this tuple to a variable named `second_last_health`
   Then uncomment the `assert` statement to confirm the variable matches the expected value.

3. Working with the list `marginalized_comm`, call the appropriate string method that accepts an
   _iterable_ (e.g., a list) as an argument and returns a new string composed of the
   `marginalized_comm` elements, each of which is separated by a period/fullstop (.). Next, assign
   the new string to a variable named `marginalized_comm_str`
   Then uncomment the `assert` statement to confirm the variable matches the expected value.

## 5.0 Problem 05 (15 Points)

**Task:** Create lists and find values using slicing.

1. Slice every odd-indexed value from the list `health` and assign the resulting list to a variable
   called `odd_index_health`.

   :bulb: Hint: Make sure to carefully choose the `step` value within a list slice.

2. Slice the 2nd, 3rd and 4th values in _reverse_ order from the list `academic` using
   **negative indexes**. Assign the resulting list to a variable named `academic_sub_list`, and
   uncomment the `assert` statement to confirm the variable matches the expected value.

   :bulb: Hint: Make sure to carefully choose the `step` value within a list slice along with the `start`
   and `stop` values.

3. Reverse the list `marginalized_comm` using negative indexes. Assign the resulting list to a
   variable called `marginalized_comm_reversed`.

   :exclamation: Your statement _must not_ use the `.reverse()` method.

## 6.0 Problem 06 (10 points)

**Task:** Return a slice of the list `academic` using various list methods.

1. Use the appropriate list method to return the index of the last element in the list `academic`
   (i.e., `Dean of Students Office|734-764-7420`). Assign the value to a variable named
   `student_dean_index`.

   :exclamation: You _must_ employ the appropriate list method to retrieve the index value of this
   element.

2. Use `student_dean_index` in a slicing expression that slices two (`2`) elements from `academic`
   _in the following order_:

   1. `Dean of Students Office|734-764-7420`
   2. `Office of the Ombuds|734-763-3545`

   Assign the slice to a variable named `academic_sub_list`, and uncomment the associated `assert` statement
   to confirm the variable matches the expected value.
