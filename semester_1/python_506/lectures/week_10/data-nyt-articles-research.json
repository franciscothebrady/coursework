Faced with a disconnect between their actions and their sensations, their minds conjured another explanation: a separate presence in the room.",

Bacteria release toxins that start the body's process of speedily evacuating the contents of the stomach. It's a protective mechanism of sorts — getting rid of the invaders en masse is probably helpful in the long term, even if it's unpleasant in the short. But it has remained something of a mystery how the brain gets the alarm signal, then sends another one to tell the stomach to initiate a technicolor yawn.",

The brain of the sperm whale is the largest on Earth, at a hefty 20 pounds, while your three-pound brain is seven times as large as expected for the average human body. Collectively, mammals have the largest ratio of brain to body size among vertebrates, a fact that helps to explain their cognitive ability. Bigger brains are often better at coordinating complex behavior, solving puzzles and responding to environmental change.",
