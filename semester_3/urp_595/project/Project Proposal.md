## Public-Private Partnership (P3) Project Proposal

TO: Mr. Luke Bonner
FROM: Francisco Brady
DATE: September 6, 2024
SUBJECT: Proposal for Infill Development in Wicker Park, Chicago, IL

This memo proposes a public-private partnership for an infill site redevelopment to reuse and build on a recently vacated historic building in Wicker Park, Chicago. The project will add multifamily apartments on top of an existing historic building for a mix of market rate and affordable rentals, and house a city-owned co-op grocery store on the ground floor, along with other spaces for local retail businesses.

Project Rationale:
This project will add to the affordable rental stock in the area. It repurposes a vacant historic building, formerly a Walgreens, preventing urban blight. The development will provide essential services to the community through its mixed-use design.

Market:
The project targets the Wicker Park neighborhood in Chicago. It aims to serve low-to-moderate income families and higher income professionals attracted to the amenities and lifestyle in Wicker Park. The retail spaces will prioritize local businesses as tenants.

Investor Appeal:
The development offers a desirable location with a robust real estate market. It provides diversified revenue streams from both residential rentals and commercial rents. A partnership with the city to establish the grocery co-op ensures anchor tenant stability. Historic Preservation Tax Credits could enhance the project's financial viability.

Public Partner Appeal:
The project allows for private management of rental units, reducing public administrative burden. It will increase the supply of affordable housing in a high-demand area. The co-op grocery store would address local food security concerns in the community. The development utilizes state tax incentives to support local economic growth and historic preservation.

This partnership aligns public policy goals with private sector efficiency, creating a win-win situation for all stakeholders involved.
