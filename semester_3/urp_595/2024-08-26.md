Form based codes: A form-based code is a land development regulation that fosters predictable built results and a high-quality public realm by using physical form (rather than separation of uses) as the organizing principle for the codeâ€¦. Form-based codes address the relationship between building facades and the public realm, the form and mass of buildings in relation to one another, and the scale and types of streets and blocks.

### Mercedes Benz Stadium
- Very expensive
- Mixed use aspect
- Surrounding area around the stadium can see increased development
- Municipality will typically issue bonds to finance
-- Bonds are a government debt security that pays a fixed interest rate for a specified period of time, and then repays the principal amount of the bond when it matures.
- New developments are usually in TIF districts
-- TIFs are Tax Increment Financing: a public financing method that is used as a subsidy for redevelopment, infrastructure, and other community-improvement projects in many countries, including the United States. The original intent of a TIF program is to stimulate private investment in a blighted area that has been designated to be in need of economic revitalization.

### Tax Increment Financing

Example: 
- Homes have market value and taxable values
- TIF works off the basis of the taxable value of a property
- For example: Home is worth $10, and you put in $20 of investment into the home.
- In large projects, the difference between the starting value and the ending value is the increment that goes back to the developer to pay off the bonds that were issued to finance the project.
