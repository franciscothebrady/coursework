### What is statistics? 

Basics of statistics
- Statistics is the science of understanding data, and making decisions in the face of uncertainty.
Exploring and visualizing data, and eventually conducting more rigorous testing on the data.
- How to design studies, collecting data, analyze data, and learn what the data are teling us.

Two types of statistics:
- Descriptive statistics: summarize, describe data
- Inferential statistics: make inferences and predictions based on data

### Why study statistics?

- Data helps us to better understand the world.
- Data gives us critical information on how the world is organized
- 521 is a starting point, basic tools to help us understand and explore the data

### What we will focus on
- how to understand public health data
- prepare you to read and interpret literature
- prepare you to analyze data from relevant studies

### Course Description

Public health is the science of protecting and improving the health of people and their communities
Scientific hypotheses in public health tested by collecting and examining relevant data
Biostatistical analysis provides means to identify and verify patterns in data and to interpret findings in a public health context
In 521, students will learn (we hope!) the basic steps in analyzing public health data, from initial study design to exploratory data analysis to statistical inference
You will not learn everything you will ever need to know about analyzing data in one class, but we hope you will be better prepared to apply statistical concepts in research and practice

### Course Topics

1. Introduction to Data and Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Introduction to Statistical Inference
3. Inference for Numerical Data
4. Inference for Categorical Data
5. Simple Linear Regression
6. Multiple Linear Regression

Some Suggestions for Learning Biostatistics
• Be an active learner: go to class, ask questions, go to office hours
• Recognize math classes are different than other classes; homework and lab
problem solving is critical to learning
• Read textbook assignments prior to class
• Print and read lecture notes prior to class and take notes on them in class
• Do homework problems soon after class to get a good idea of what you do and
do not understand
• Let us know if you are having problems; this course is for you; help us help you!
• If you are new to coding, take advantage of lab and consider trying to find a
coding “buddy” who can help; if you are more expert, help others 11

• Think of homework assignments as the minimum standard; doing more helps
• Grading based primarily on completion
• Answer keys will be posted on Canvas; please review them 19
Computer Lab Assignments (1)
• Assumption: you want to analyze data with the goal to write research
papers or improve practice
• Seek to avoid: “I understood everything from the lecture, but I still have
no idea how to analyze data”
• Data do not come with analysis instructions (except in some homework
problems)
• Goal of lab assignments: prepare you to confidently begin a data
analysis and understand the logical process
20
Computer Lab Assignments (2)
• “Authentic learning experience” designed to prepare you to analyze
datasets from your own field using statistical software R
• Provide a roadmap consisting of four open-ended modules over the
course of the semester
• Designed to mimic steps in a real statistical analysis
• Link lecture material with hands-on application
• Choose one dataset to analyze for the semester: epidemiology,
environmental health, nutrition
21

figures and/or tables along
with text describing your
methods and results
• Finished report will resemble
Results section from a public
health research paper
• You can look at public health
papers for inspiration
NHANES Study (1)
• National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
• https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/about_nhanes.htm
• Assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the US by
surveys that combine interviews and physical exams
• Begun in the 1960s; expanded to continuous program collecting data on a
nationally representative sample of ~5,000 people each year
• Major data source for public health research
• Becoming familiar with NHANES data a benefit of the computer labs 23
24* Not all data collected on every sample
NHANES Study (2)
Three NHANES Datasets for Lab
25
• Choose one dataset to analyze for the duration of the course
• Scientific questions and datasets prepared in conjunction with SPH faculty led
by Matt Zawistowski
• You should address the scientific questions posed in each lab
• These are examples based on real data, not definitive research projects
NutritionEnvironmental HealthEpidemiology
Dietary quality measured by the
Healthy Eating Index with
measures of chronic kidney
disease
Exposure to the pollutant PFOS
and markers for human health
Secondhand smoke exposure
(measured by cotinine levels
in blood) and biomarkers for
cardiovascular disease
Lab Grading Rubric
321Metric The correct statistical methods are used
throughout the analysis.
The correct statistical methods are used but
minor errors are made when analyzing the
data, or the interpretation of the results is
incorrect.
Numerous or substantial errors made
when analyzing the data. For example,
variables are used incorrectly
(exposure/outcome) or an incorrect
model is used to address the scientific
question.
Appropriate Use of
Statistical Methods
The plots, figures, and/or tables are
appropriate to accomplish the goals of
the lab. They are organized,
informative and easy to interpret.
The plots, figures, and/or tables are
appropriate to accomplish the goals of the lab
but contain minor errors, are difficult to
interpret, or are visually unappealing.
The plots, figures and/or tables contain
incorrect data and/or do not accomplish
the goals of the lab.
Visual Presentation of
Data and Results
The statistical analysis thoroughly
addresses all goals. The analysis also
successfully accomplishes and
interprets the challenge for the lab.
The statistical analysis addresses all required
goals of the lab.
The statistical analysis does not
sufficiently address the goals of the lab.
All analyses might be correct but
certain goals were not assessed in a
statistical manner.
Creativity of Analysis
(aka Challenge Point)
Student displayed a mastery of the
concepts by clear description of results
along with a thorough interpretation in
the context of the scientific problem.
Statistical results are correctly and clearly
communicated in a well-written narrative.
Incomplete sentences or poor grammar
are used in the written portion of the
lab. Interpretation of results are
incorrect or not supported by the
presented statistical results.

description in the rubric.
Computer Lab Sessions
• Lab sections meet in SPH computing labs and are led by GSIs
• Labs begin next week
• First lab session a tutorial (Lab #0); format varies afterward
• Attendance required for first lab, optional but encouraged thereafter
• Labs include a mix of GSI presentations and Q & A for lab and homework
assignments
• Use lab time to ask questions and seek feedback from your GSI as you
complete each lab module
27
Computer Labs Use R
• The focus of the labs is on planning and executing an analysis,
and interpreting and reporting results
• This is NOT a programming class, but modern statistical analysis requires
basic use of statistical software
• We use the free, open-source software R for labs and some homework
• If you are new to coding, you should anticipate a learning curve
• R and the RStudio interface can be downloaded; documentation on
installing R at https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html
• We encourage you to install R and RStudio prior to attending your first
lab session 28
Academic Integrity
• Student conduct in SPH courses should be consistent with that of a professional
person
• Courtesy, honesty, and respect should be shown by students to faculty members,
GSIs, staff, and fellow students
• Students should expect faculty, GSIs, and staff to treat them fairly, show respect for
their ideas and opinions, and strive to help them achieve maximum benefits from their
SPH experience
• Student academic misconduct includes plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, falsification
of records or official documents, intentional misuse of equipment or materials, and
aiding and abetting such acts
• You are welcome to work together on assignments, but we ask that you submit
solutions and reports written only by you
• You must not share information on an exam with other students during the exam29
Artificial Intelligence (1)
• Generative AI is rapidly changing the world in which we live and work
• We cannot predict how the teaching, learning, and practice of biostatistics will
change due to AI in the coming years (or days!)
• We do know that homework and lab assignments provide a critically important
opportunity to practice skills and build understanding of the material in any math
class, including Biostatistics 521
• Just as we encourage your participation in study groups and office hours, we are
fine with your use of AI tools as study aides, including for homeworks and labs
• However, we believe, at least for now, carrying out the reasoning and writing on
your own is a better learning strategy for 521 material and will prepare you better
for the future 30
Artificial Intelligence (2)
• Therefore, we ask that your responses to all homework and lab assignments be
in your own words and not taken from AI
• If you use AI to help with your homework or lab assignments or create code based
on or derived from AI-generated code, please make sure you document the use of
AI by including: (1) the name of the AI tool used and (2) your prompt to the AI tool
• We cannot police your response to this recommendation, which is why homework
and lab grading will largely reflect completion rather than correctness of content
• Use of AI on exams is strictly forbidden and will be enforced by not allowing use
of any smart electronic devices during exams; violation of this policy will be
considered cheating and dealt with accordingly
31
Student Well-Being
• SPH faculty and staff are committed to supporting the physical and
emotional well-being of our students
• CAPS (Counseling and Psychological Services) provides free and
confidential counseling to enrolled students https://caps.umich.edu/
• Our SPH-embedded CAPS counselor is Joe Rizzo (joerizzo@umich.edu)
