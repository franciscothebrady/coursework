### Announcements

Office hours and lab sessions start this week

### Exploratory Data Analysis
 once the data is collected you can start the analysis
this is the most important step in the overall analysis
- often ignored or underappreciated

allows you to understand the individual variables in your dataset
- convince yourself the data are of good quality
- explain the dataset to yourself and others

initial focus is on the data type for each variable in the dataset
- will determine the appropriate methods to summarize and analyze the data

graphics provide summaries of the dataset that can't be determined by just looking at the numbers

### Big picture

#### The research process
1. develop a scientific question
2. collect data
3. analyze data
4. make conclusions about scientific question
--> go back to step 1

last week we talked about the study design and the question
now we have the data and we are ready to start the analysis

### analyzing data

#### Exploratory Data Analysis

- what is going on in your data?
- did you get what you thought you would?
- simple summaries of data
- does your data make sense? (sanity checks)

#### inferential analysis

- translate scientific questions into statistical hypothesis
- determine appropriate statistical tests
- build models (and then try different ones)
- quantify statistical evidence

#### interpret and summarize statistical results
- organize results, what is important to report?
- what do the statistical findings say about the scientific questions?
- how strong is the evidence?

### Data types

two general categories:
- numerical variables
- levels, groups, categorical variables

| Data Type | Subtype | Description | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Numerical | Continuous | data can be any number value within a range | blood pressure, distance living from highway, GPA |
| Numerical | Discrete | data can only take on a fixed set of values in range | cups of coffee per day, copies of a recessive allele (0/1/2), number of children |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Categorical | Nominal | variable with discrete labels that cannot be ordered |
| Categorical | Ordinal | variable with discrete labels and a natural ordering | drug use (none/low/high), highest degree attained (HS, College, Masters, PhD/MD) |

* a categorical variable with only two levels is called *binary*

### Examples

1. Sex: Categorical (nominal) -- no ordering
2. Age: Numerical (discrete) -- in this dataset is discrete, but sometimes it can be continuous (14.5)
3. Highest Education Level: Categorical (Ordinal) -- there is a natural ordering
4. HDL: Numerical (continuous) -- continuous variable

### Converting Data Types

- it is possible to convert data between different types
- typically it is best to keep numerical variables as is

Example:
- Create a variable for over 21: 0 (Age < 21), 1 (Age >= 21)

### Distinctions Between Data Types

- distinction between numerical and categorical is the most important
- distinction between nominal and ordinal is usually obvious
- distinction between discrete and continuous is a bit of a gray zone

### Can it be both?

- a variable can be both numerical and categorical
- for example, a survey might ask you to rate something on a scale (best to worst)
- that can be numerical, discrete or categorical, ordinal

### Describing Distributions

- distributions describe the overall pattern of data (shape, center, spread)

#### Shape
- how many peaks (modes)?
    - unimodal: one peak
    - multimodal: multiple peaks
    - flat: no clear peaks
- is it skewed in one direction or another?
- right skew: right tail longer than left tail
- left skew: left tail longer than right tail

#### Center
- the midpoint of the data

#### Spread
- range between the smallest and the largest values

Note: look for outliers -- individual values that do not match the overall pattern

### transforming numerical data

- highly skewed numerical data can distort any meaningful information
- transforming the data can help to spread out the data

Example: population of US counties
- a small number of US metropolitan area counties have large populations
- this obscures the distribution of US county populations overall
- log transformation can help to spread out the data and make it more informative

Exploratory Data Analysis
Once data has been collected it is time to start an analysis.
Exploratory data analysis is the first step in analyzing data. It is a critical piece of the overall analysis
but is often ignored or underappreciated.
Exploratory data analysis allows you to understand the individual variables in your dataset, convince
yourself the data are of good quality, and explain the dataset to yourself and others.
An initial focus is on the data type for each variable in the dataset; the data type will determine the
appropriate methods to summarize and analyze the data.
Pictures are worth a thousand words. Graphical representations provide invaluable summaries of the
dataset that cannot be determined by looking at numbers or counts on a spreadsheet.

Distinctions Between Data Types
15
• Distinction between Numerical and Categorical is the most important
• Distinction between Nominal and Ordinal is usually obvious for a given categorical variable
• Distinction between Discrete and Continuous is a bit of a gray zone and the distinction is not critical
• Choosing between Discrete and Continuous can be a matter of convenience for reporting the data
(i.e., is it easier to report each individual numerical data value (discrete) or the number that fall
within different ranges (continuous)).
Can it be both?

A survey might ask you to rate something on a scale.
For example, how would you rate your Biostatistics Instructor?
The responses can be considered either Numerical, Discrete or Categorical, Ordinal data.
That is, you can analyze this data under either format, and both would be valid!
The important part is that if you decide on Categorical, it is certainly ordinal.
 The techniques to analyze the variable will differ but the message should be the same.

The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an annual telephone survey of 350,000 people
in the United States. As its name implies, the BRFSS is designed to identify risk factors in the adult population
and report emerging health trends. We will consider a subset of 20,000 samples from BRFSS.
Who makes up this dataset?
Young people, old people? Male/Female ratio? Healthy or unhealthy?
Goal of an Exploratory Data Analysis is to learn about the cohort and the variables in the dataset 18
Exploratory Data Analysis
What might you want to describe in this data?
• Distributions of individual variables (Univariate analysis)
• Relationships between pairs of variables (Bivariate analysis) 19

Examining Numerical Distributions
• Distributions describe the overall pattern of data – the shape, center and spread.
• Shape
• How many peaks (modes)?
• Symmetric or skewed in one direction (is one tail longer?)
• Right skew: right tail longer than left tail
• Left skew: left tail longer than right tail
• Center – midpoint of the data
• Spread – range between the smallest and the largest values
• Look for outliers – individual values that do not match the overall pattern

1. Month of birth for all students in this class?
2. Year of birth for all students in this class?
3. Year of birth for all participants in this class (including Xiang)?
4. Number of siblings for all participants in this class; do we expect including
instructor to make much difference this time?

Extreme Measurements = Outliers
• Viewing the distribution of a numerical variable allows you to identify outliers, or
extreme measurements that do not fit within the range of majority of observations
• Always try to identify the reason for an outlier
• Is it a measurement error?
• Biologically impossible measurements?
• Think: number of pregnancies >0 in men, negative blood pressure measurements,
thousands of alcohol drinks per week
• Is there something different about the observations that explains the extreme value?
• A measurement can be an outlier without being a “bad” data point 27
Outlier Measurements: Time Usage for 521 Canvas Site
• Canvas allows me to see the cumulative amount of time on Canvas for each student
28
• Distribution of time spent on the course website is right
skewed
 Typical when there is a fixed lower bound
• Two observations are extreme in relation to the bulk of
the data; explanations?
 Note that they are at least feasible measurements, but:
 -5.27? That would be impossible!
 326? Perhaps a units problem: minutes instead of
hours?

Transforming Numerical Data
• Highly skewed numerical data can appear as a single bar containing nearly all observations
• A couple extreme values obscure the spread in the majority of observations

Population of US Counties
A small number of US
metropolitan area counties
have large populations,
obscuring distribution of US
county populations overall.
Transforming Numerical Data
• A variable transformation rescales numerical measurement according to a mathematical function
• Log transformation is most common
• The logarithm function spreads out smaller numbers and pulls back large numbers
• Often easier to model the log of a variable rather than the original scale (usually prefer symmetric distributions)
31
Population Data on
original scale
Population Data on Log scale
• More difficult to interpret
• More informative distribution
Distributions of Categorical Data
• Categorical variables take on a fixed number of possible values or levels
• Bar plots give graphical display of the observed counts for each level of a categorical variable
• If the categorical variable is ordinal, retain the natural ordering when creating the bar plot

Exercise and Health Plan in the BRFSS Data
39
Have you exercised in past month?
No Yes No Yes
Do you have health insurance?
What did we learn about BRFSS Data?
Exploratory Analysis told us…
• Wide age range, from 18 years old up to 100.
• Distribution of age is right skewed, meaning more younger samples
• Relatively balanced on sex, slightly more females than males
• Overall, the cohort is in very good health and the vast majority performed some recent exercise
• There are a couple weight measurements that stood out from the rest of the cohort but are not
biologically unrealistic
Now that we know something about the data, we can think about what scientific questions can be
addressed with the BRFSS dataset…
40
Which of the following research topics might
be explore in the BRFSS dataset?
• Health disparities in the uninsured?
• Smoking experience in teenagers?
• Idealized perceptions of weight in males and females?
• Exercise habits by age?
• What else?
41
Summary
• Exploratory data analysis makes plots to learn about the data
• Data type of a variable determines which plotting techniques are appropriate
• Univariate plots tell us about the distribution of individual variables
• Bivariate plots will tell us about the relationships between pairs of variables (coming
soon)
• Remember: making the plot is only the first step!
Once you have made a plot, ask yourself what information is being conveyed.
Use the plots to learn about the variables and the cohort.
