### Stata Probit Example

```stata
probit VotedBiden PoliticalNews Ideology FauciTherm BLMTherm BAPlus
```

#### Interpretation
- Sign of the coefficients indicates the direction of the relationship

### R Probit Example

```r
probit_model <- glm(VotedBiden ~ PoliticalNews + Ideology + FauciTherm + BLMTherm + BAPlus, family = binomial(link = "probit"), data = data)
probit_sum <- summary(probit_model)
probit_sum$coefficients
```

### Interpretation of Coefficients

- Sign of the coefficients indicates the direction of the relationship between $x$'s and $Pr(y_i = 1)$
- To understand the magnitude of the effect, we must determine by how much $\phi(x_i \beta)$ changes in response to a particular change in $x_i$
- This eddect depends upon the values of all the variables in the analysis, since the starting point on the S-shaped curve matters.
- there is no direct way to interpret the magnitude of the change in probability in the same way that we can interpret the change in the log-odds in the logit model.

### Different ways to interpret probit results
- Predicted Probabilty: Calculate $Pr(y_i = 1)$ given the values of the x's for a particular case
- Change in Predicted Probability: Calculate the change in $Pr(y_i = 1)$ when x's change from one set of values to another.
- Marginal Effect: The predicted effect on $Pr(y_i = 1)$ from changing one $x_i$, starting qat specified values for the x's
- Average Marginal Effect: The average effect on $Pr(y_i = 1)$ from changing one $x_i$, calculated across all the cases in the sample.
    - each case is evaluted at it's own values for the x's

### Calculating a Predicted Probability

The probability of a vote for Biden is $\phi (x_i \beta)$. If PoliticalNews=2, Ideology=3, FauciTherm=65, BLMtherm=60, and BAplus=1 then:

$$
x_i \beta = −1.472 + .150(PoliticalNews) − .472(Ideology)
+.022(FauciTherm) + .023(BLMtherm) + .155(BAplus)
= −1.47 + .15(2) − .472(3) + .022(65) + .023(60) + .155(1)
= .377
$$

- To find probability, evaluate $\phi(.377) = .65$

### Commands for Predicted Values

```stata
# to return predicted probabilities (default)
margins, predict() at (var1 = 2 var2 = 3 var3 = 65 var4 = 60 var5 = 1)
# to return predicted xb values
margins, predict(xb) at (var1 = 2 var2 = 3 var3 = 65 var4 = 60 var5 = 1)
```

### Predicted Probabilities Across a Range of Variables

```stata
margins, predict() at(x1=2 x2=(2(1)10) x3=4)
```
